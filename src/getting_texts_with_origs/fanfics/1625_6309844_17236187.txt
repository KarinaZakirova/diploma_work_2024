At first she changed all in his arms
Into a wild wolf
He held her tight and feared her not
She was his own true love
And then she changed all in his arms
Into a wild bear
He held her tight and feared her not
He was her husband dear
And then she changed all in his arms
Into a lion bold
He held her tight and feared her not
The father of her child
