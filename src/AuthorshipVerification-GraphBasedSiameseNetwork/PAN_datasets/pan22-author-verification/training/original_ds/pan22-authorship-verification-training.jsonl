{"id": "f56017a5-68d5-4fd1-bae9-f31ab29443c2", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Over the last few years EMNE’s have become more prominent within the globalised world we now live in. These firms have had a significant boost since 2002; also referred to as the ‘going global era.’ They tend to come from emerging, upper-middle income economies and developing countries and use a variety of entry modes such as joint ventures, strategic alliances and wholly owned subsidiaries (Guillen &amp; Garcia-Canal, 2009). However, the majority choose to expand rapidly into developed countries using M&amp;A’s and are late movers. A growing number of EMNE’s are starting to dominate certain industries such as banking, telecommunications and engineering and outward FDI from emerging countries is increasing. For example, China has increased its presence within the Fortune 500 between 2004 and 2019; whilst the presence of US firms has started to decrease, showing the ever-growing dominance of EMNE’s (Fortune Global 500, 2004,2019). There’s several firms many of us from the western world may not have realised are owned by EMNE’s, such as Tetley being owned by TATA – an Indian conglomerate; meaning it owns several different types of businesses and McVitie’s being owned by Turkish EMNE, Yildiz Holding.<nl>This essay will highlight the key differences between MNE’s and EMNE’s and examine how effective current theories are at explaining outward FDI from emerging country multinationals and compare and contrast them to the more recent theories which have been developed; including the LLL model and Springboard theory. Some academics believe these new EMNE’s have different motivations, which don’t necessarily fit in with the traditional theories; whilst others think that these theories can be applied just as effectively as the newer ones. <nl>Key differences between traditional western MNE’s and EMNE’s<nl>Only a decade ago many EMNE’s, which are booming today and challenging some of the most established MNE’s in many industries, were marginal competitors. So how have they managed to do this in such a short space of time and be successful? It’s important to look at the key characteristics of both traditional MNE’s and the newer EMNE’s to see what makes them so different. A main difference is the speed they internationalise. Many traditional MNE’s expand gradually, following the Uppsala model whereby they expand into countries which are psychologically close considering factors such as, geography, shared language and shared cultures. On the other hand, EMNE’s expand at a more accelerated pace. They do this to close the gap between their market reach and the global presence of MNE’s from developed countries (Mathews, 2006). A good example of an EMNE which has expanded rapidly is Chinese firm Huawei. In just five years, despite starting as a domestic firm in 2001, it was operating in over 100 countries by 2006. It did this by providing solid technology at low prices and hiring low cost engineers at 20% of western rates. This allowed them to strongly compete against western MNE’s and expand quickly (Fey et al, 2016). EMNE’s also use latecomer advantage whereby they learn from mistakes of MNE’s already established in the market and do better themselves. MNE’s are essentially used as ‘guinea pigs.’ With regards to ownership advantages many MNE’s have the required resources available to them internally; making this a big advantage if they were to expand into developing countries. However, EMNE’s are sometimes seen as having weak ownership advantages, but many believe this is debatable as their institutional advantages are so strong and they can also just obtain resources and capabilities through M&amp;A’s; which would naturally upgrade their ownership advantages. <nl>Institutional advantages are another key element to consider when comparing the firms. It’s well documented that traditional MNE’s have struggled significantly in countries with institutional voids as they’re used to political stability; due to coming from countries with highly stable environments. As a result, they don’t have the same experiences to cope with instability in the same way as EMNE’S. New EMNE’s are known to have this as a big advantage over traditional MNE’s, as they’re used to dealing and complying with discretionary and unstable governments in their domestic countries, therefore meaning they’re better prepared to succeed in foreign countries with weak institutional environments (Cuervo-Cazurra &amp; Genc, 2008). It’s also believed that if EMNE’s can successfully thrive in unstable developing countries, they most certainly can be successful in stable, developed countries. Finally, there’s key differences in the organisational adaptability of MNE’s versus EMNE’s. It’s believed that EMNE’s are much more adaptable than MNE’s which tend to suffer from inertia, by being stuck in their ways, as they have deeply ingrained values, cultures and organisational structures (Guillen &amp; Garcia-Canal, 2009). Consequently, they tend to have lower success rates with M&amp;A’s due to their lack of adaptability - almost two thirds of acquisitions by western firms end in failure, as the acquirer doesn’t give flexibility to the firm acquired. On the other hand, EMNE’s tend to have a high M&amp;A success rate - 67% success rate, as their adaptability is high, and they appreciate the firm they acquire more; due to their lack of global presence. <nl>Existing theories and their relevance<nl>Two major theories which explain the existing ways firms expand overseas successfully are Dunning’s Eclectic Paradigm and the Uppsala Model. Dunning uses OLI theory to explain why firms use outward FDI; suggesting the key advantages as being ownership advantages, location advantages and internalisation advantages. Ownership advantages refer to valuable resources and capabilities a firm offers a country it expands into, which gives them a competitive advantage. Many argue that due to their lack of capabilities and resources, coming from developing countries, EMNE’s can’t satisfy this part of the OLI paradigm. Going by Dunning’s explanation this would mean that they’re unable to engage in outward FDI, however many still do and are proven successful. Furthermore, some believe EMNE’s from developing countries could be considered to have ownership disadvantages, as they lack a well-known image and may not have the ability to compete on the same scale as western MNE’s, who have larger finances and advanced technologies (Fey et al, 2016). In addition, location advantages are required by Dunning to expand overseas effectively; this is what host countries can offer to a firm undertaking FDI there (Dunning, 1979). However, many EMNE’s don’t go abroad to access location advantages, such as lower cost production, lower labour costs or cheaper technology; as they already have this available to them in their domestic markets. For example, many Chinese firms won’t outsource their production to a developed country if they’re to expand their firm into them, because it’s well documented that production and labour within China can be done at a much cheaper cost to say that in the US.  As both ownership advantages and location advantages aren’t satisfied in the OLI paradigm, it makes it possible to say that the theory could become redundant or less relevant as more EMNE’S become successful in developed markets; without having satisfied all three elements within the paradigm. <nl>Secondly, the Uppsala model is another model used to explain the internationalisation of firms. It emphasises how firms go abroad incrementally and increase commitments gradually. This may mean they go into countries close to their domestic market first. A firm may first export to a country, then open an overseas subsidiary and finally build or acquire their own factory abroad as they gain more knowledge about the market and establish their operations. EMNE’S are unfortunately thought to leapfrog some steps outlined above and may even start the internationalisation process by becoming ‘born global’ and setting up the factory first. According to Eriksson et al (2000), the Uppsala Model is based on the idea that the behaviour of the internationalisation process is path dependent. Path dependence is a process based on the accumulated knowledge from the firm’s past international experience, which directs the firm’s future trajectory (Eriksson et al, 2000). A main concern is that Uppsala explains this path dependence but EMNE’s have no experience in developed countries to use. As a result, they can only use knowledge of developing countries. On the other hand, MNE’s know all about operating in developed markets so are at a bigger advantage. Finally, part of the Uppsala model is the idea of psychic distance - entering countries psychologically close. A main issue with this idea is that EMNE’s may not be able to use psychic distance to enter developed countries because they’re so different in nature. For example, developing countries may have stronger cultural, language, political and legal differences to developed countries. This would also be the case for MNE’s looking to expand into developing countries. <nl>The development of new theories<nl>As time has progressed new theories have been developed to try to explain and analyse how these new EMNE’s have used outward FDI to expand their presence internationally. The reason for creating these theories is because many couldn’t understand how these firms from countries with weaker country specific advantages could compete against the firms from developed countries. At first glance, it appears these EMNE’s have weaker firm specific advantages compared to their western rivals. <nl>The springboard theory was created (Luo and Tung, 2007) to explain why these firms expand so aggressively and the drivers behind this. The theory highlights seven elements. The first being that EMNE’s use their international expansion to compensate for their ownership disadvantages; this means that to counteract the fact they can’t offer a lot initially in terms of resources to the new market, they expand internationally and benefit from other means such as gaining resources from another firm through a M&amp;A. Immediately, this makes the OLI paradigm seem less relevant, as it’s highlighting that they can still be a success without initial ownership advantages. The second element of the theory says that EMNE’s use the international expansion to overcome their latecomer disadvantage; this means that they benefit from being able to see where MNE’s have made mistakes and ensuring they don’t make the same ones. Next, it explains that MNE’s from developing countries use international expansion as a springboard to counter-attack global rivals’ major foothold in their home country market. It also outlines that EMNE’s use outward FDI as a springboard to bypass certain trade barriers, such as quotas and anti-dumping penalties. This means that they go into another developingemerging markets with fewer restrictions. For example, if a Chinese firm were to set up a foreign subsidiary or production in Mexico and then export their good to the US. This again goes against the OLI paradigm as the firm isn’t directly using the location advantages of the US for production in the example above. Instead, they’re choosing to use those of Mexico to then sell in the US. Furthermore, the theory says new emerging MNE’s expand internationally to alleviate domestic institutional constraints. This for example could be if their home country doesn’t have strong patent laws, so they take their product elsewhere to be better protected therefore, benefitting from the county’s location advantage of having stronger patent protection. The final two elements explain that EMNE’s use international expansion to both secure preferential treatment offered by emerging governments and exploit their competitive advantage in other markets. To secure preferential treatment a domestic firm, say an Indian firm, may set up a subsidiary within the UK and then invest back into India to gain the tax benefit and the preferential government treatment. <nl>A second new theory developed is the LLL model (Mathews, 2006). This model has similarities to the Springboard theory in the way it explains why EMNE’s expand and internationalise. However, the key takeaway is that it says EMNE’s go abroad and then they learn. This is a massive contrast to the Uppsala model which emphasises the gradual process of expansion and firms using the knowledge they already possess to expand into markets with similarities, that are psychologically close. Firms going abroad and then learning highlights a more aggressive approach to expansion.  The three L’s in the model stand for linkage, leverage and learning. The linkage element examines the collaborations between EMNE’s and foreign firms through entry modes such as joint ventures, M&amp;A’s and alliances. Leverage explains that EMNE’s exploit global linkages to become ‘latecomers’ by harnessing resources and cost advantages to compete globally.  The second ‘L’ really highlights the idea that firms go abroad and then learn from the foreign partners already in the market and demonstrates why Dunning’s theory is less relevant of initially having certain ownership advantages to be successful. Finally, the learning element is the stage where EMNE’s acquire competitive advantages and learn how to compete internationally. Firms don’t need initial advantages necessarily; as they can expand and then learn and therefore become competitive. Overall, this model argues that firms acquire resources and learn over time before internationalisation occurs and the EMNE is integrated into the international activities. <nl>Although these theories have been developed and are more tailored to the new types of EMNE’s, they do still have their drawback such as underestimating the importance of absorption capacity and they go against the path dependence theory; as expressed in the Uppsala model. Finally, it’s clear that the importance of ownership advantages is dismissed; which is a key element in the existing OLI paradigm. <nl>In summary, it’s evident EMNE’s and traditional MNE’s differ both in the way they operate and the way they internationalise. Key differences include the speed EMNE’s internationalise compared with MNE’s and how differently they use or even don’t use their initial ownership advantages to ensure success abroad. Although they have their differences, both types of firm have proven to be successful in their own ways. However, there’s still a huge question mark over how these newer EMNE’s have prevailed so much globally. Thus, newer theories have been developed to try and explain this dominance. It must be said that although these new theories more accurately explain the rapid growth of EMNE’s and why having ownership advantages isn’t as essential as some older theories may suggest; they do still have their criticisms, as explained above. Consequently, further theories may have to be developed which are more accurate and less open to scrutiny. However, it really depends on individual views as to which theories are considered more relevant. Some would argue Dunning and the Uppsala model have been used for many years and can still be used effectively today, whilst others may say the world is constantly changing, as seen with the recent rise of EMNE’s, and therefore it’s necessary to keep developing and updating new theories. This will make them most effective and relevant to the current situations firms and countries find themselves in. For example, Carl Fey and others developed a new 5M framework which guides academics in their understanding of the internationalisation of EMNE’s (Fey et al, 2009). It proved that internationalisation is challenging for any firm. The largest challenge for EMNE’s, which is not always covered by the older theories, is overcoming the problem of a negative country image (Y.Y. Chang et al., 2009; E.Chang &amp; Taylor., 1999; Ferner et al., 2005; Smith &amp; Meiksins, 1995). It’s the job of newer theories to potentially provide insight into how EMNE’’s can overcome this challenge.", "<addr8_FN>,<nl><nl>Thank you for the document I believe this will help a lot.<nl><nl>Have a great Christmas!<nl><nl>Kind Regards,<nl><nl><part_FN> <new>Yes thank you <addr1_FN>🙂<nl><nl>Have a great Christmas!<nl><nl><part_FN><new>Hi <addr1_FN>,<nl><nl>I just had one final question for the <module> essay I forgot to ask during our meeting.<nl><nl>Do you think it would be a good idea to use an example such as the <business> case for the <topic> question?<nl><nl>Many thanks<nl><nl><part_FN><new>Hi <addr3_FN>,<nl><nl>None of us can seem to access the exam.

{"id": "0657bef5-7f47-44d1-952c-bc7ab282bc1b", "discourse_types": ["essay", "text_message"], "pair": ["Understanding what the modern state is, is linked to understanding its historical emergence and identifying its four key characteristics, a claim over territory, external and internal sovereignty, a claim to legitimacy, and bureaucracy. A common view is that the modern state emerged when the fifteenth century absolutist state came to be seen as separate from an individual ruler (Kamrava, 2012). Defining the state differs depending upon whether the concept of force or morality is stressed, or a combination of both (Hoffman and Graham, 2013). As this essay aims to examine the relevance of philosopher, Machiavelli in accordance with his view of the state, a definition based on a mixture of will and force will firstly be explored through an analysis of his most notable work, The Prince. Exposure to the key themes from, Discourses on Livy will also ensure an efficient examination of the usefulness of his ideas in understanding the nature of the modern state. To further assess the effectiveness of relevance, an exploration of scholarly texts on his beliefs on human nature will be present, along with his political philosophy, informed by evaluations of princely and republican regimes of native Italy. To strengthen the critical examination, thoughts of other political philosophers, including, Aristotle, Rousseau, and the influenced Gramsci, will be used to emphasise the inherent flaws he is often recognised and highly criticised for.<nl>Italian Marxist Gramsci, who viewed the state as not containing just one central attribute, traced his view back to Machiavelli’s The Prince, that stated there are two means of fighting: ‘one according to the laws, the other with force; the first way is proper to man, the second to beasts’ (Hoffman and Graham, 2013). When depicting the renaissance prince, Machiavelli argued that as the first is ‘’not sufficient to maintain power’’, it becomes ‘’necessary to have recourse to the second’’, highlighting a dual personality of which the character of a prince should comprise of (Machiavelli, 2020). The process of acquiring power is the main theme followed in The Prince, and is the key quality several political thinkers like Plato and Aristotle had concerned themselves with and had considered state-power as a means to a higher end formed in moral terms. However, Machiavelli adopted a different perspective. He believed the power of the state is the end of the state, specifically every state must aim at maximizing its power. Consequently, he confined his attention to the means beneficial to the acquisition and maintenance of power. The main way of which, was for the existence of good arms that would have coincided with good laws. In chapter XIV of the prince he writes, \"when princes have thought more of ease than of arms they have lost their states\", a statement respectable to follow not only for the rulings of 15th century Italy, but also the nature of the modern state, because we know that all states have the right to insist force to ensure their internal and external sovereignty (Machiavelli, 2020). An example in contemporary politics could be the situation in Yemen whereby there is an apparent failure to defend internal sovereignty from a domestic group challenging it, which has led to not only government corruption but also a severe humanitarian crisis. Though, we can compare the factor of state sovereignty and Machiavelli’s persistent use of ‘power’, It is important to realise that ensuring sovereignty does not mean a state is all-powerful, as it depends on many other factors, including the wealth of a state. The better funded a state is, the sovereignty results in much greater power. <nl>Like The Prince, Discourses on Livy acknowledges several interpretations. Political theorist Quentin Skinner in the 1970s, emphasised the work’s republicanism. This interpretation focuses on Machiavelli’s many pro-republican comments, such as his importance on the republican virtue of self-sacrifice as a way of preventing corruption (Skinner, 1998). However, Machiavelli’s republicanism does not follow the typical republican premise that power is safer in the hands of many rather than in the hands of one. To the contrary, he contends that, to establish or reform a republic, it is necessary to \"be alone\". Any ordering must depend on a single mind; thus, Romulus \"deserves excuse\" for committing acts of murder in the founding of Rome, because it was for the common good. This statement is as close as Machiavelli ever came to stating, \"the end justifies the means\", a phrase closely associated with interpretations of The Prince, whereby he urges for the ideal prince to only focus on the end of his endeavours, irrespective of the means (Machiavelli, 2015). Inevitably, his political philosophy looks at politics as goal driven, unbound by morals, and is represented as unscrupulous. His perspective is in direct conflict with that of Aristotle’s who supported the close relation between morality and political actions and argued that in politics there ought to be moral goals that are to be attained (Aristotle and Everson, 1988). Both Aristotle and Plato believed in the moral nature of the state, but Machiavelli entirely disregarded this view. According to him, although morality is essential for citizens, it is not necessary for the ruler, thereby issuing the distinction between private and public morality. A ruler has primary duty of preserving the state. Therefore, he has a right to use instruments of immorality like, deception and killings, for the state (Machiavelli, 2020). The idea channelled here that, absolute morality is neither possible nor desirable in politics, can be useful in understanding the nature of the modern state when considering the resurgence of a corrupt state. For example, a corrupt state cannot be reformed without a heavy amount of violence, an unacceptable method from the standards of private morality. <nl>Similar to Skinner, Jean-Jacques Rosseau interpreted The Prince as ‘’the book of Republicans\" and praised it for being a courageous essay that at last explained the distinction between judging the actions of princes and the actions of humans believed it showed how politics is autonomous from ethics (Viroli, 2013). However, Viroli, in general, and (2013) rejects Rosseau’s defence and argues that his interpretation comes from his desire to rescue Machiavelli’s bad reputation and to allow The Prince to show consistency with the Discourses on Livy. Although his intention was righteous, the view that Machiavelli deserves credit for discovering the principle of autonomy of politics from morals, is reprehensible due to the distortion of his text (Viroli, 2013). Examples of his work, cited by supporters of the theory of the autonomy of politics, refer to human beings as well as Princes. A specific example is the title and contents of chapter XV, ‘’Of Those Things for Which Men, and Particularly Princes, Are Praised or Blamed’’. The idea that he is rejecting the relevance of ethics on all human beings can be viewed here. The lack of concise differing standards presented, is what makes his work invalid to cite, for the uses of the theory of autonomy of politics. <nl>If Machiavelli did theorize the principle of the autonomy of politics, he would have formed a very poor concept, due to his strict ambition of rejecting the judgement of the actions of leaders based on ethical standards. Viroli, (2013) believes this is a weak concept because without ethical standards to judge the actions of leaders, we would have no defence against corrupt and oppressive politicians. Therefore, they should exist but when thinking about the nature of the modern state today, we must consider the reality of this in practice. <nl>Underpinning Machiavelli’s philosophy and where most of his criticism is disputed from, is a particular view of Human Nature. Having learnt from observations of numerous European leaders, Machiavelli believed that human nature was changeless and essentially evil. The Prince portrays a corrosive view of human nature, fundamentally describing humans as selfish, and unreliable, \"Men are quick to change ruler when they imagine they can improve their lot.\", irrational, \"Men are so thoughtless’’, and greedy, \"men more quickly forget the death of their father than the loss of their patrimony’’ (Machiavelli, 2020). Nevertheless, he believed these natural inclinations could be moulded by social institutions and strong leadership. Therefore, he took interest in the methods of leadership and how to organise a state to enable socialisation and the taming of human nature. On the other hand, Rousseau believed humans were naturally endowed with pity and compassion. As discussed in The Discourse on Inequality and The Social Contract, the state of nature is the hypothetical place where humans live uncorrupted by society, citing freedom of all its citizens as its most fundamental objective (Rousseau, 2002). Although many view Rousseau’s ideal society as unrealistic and utopian, his emphasis of equality has influenced liberal thought. Considering the relevance of both attitudes, in regards to the characteristics of the modern state, we can view national identity, as a powerful source of legitimacy, holding strong connection with Rousseau’s theory that the state of nature is essential in order for people to recognise their natural goodness. A state can gain legitimacy usually by some claim of citizen representation. Likewise, the function of a bureaucracy to build schools allows for citizens to gain freedom through education. Therefore, Machiavelli’s more harsh reasoning for the underdeveloped state, does not fully reflect the nature of the modern state, especially as we see it today. It is crude, and unjustly limits the natural good of human nature. <nl>Despite its cynicism, a specific concept of Machiavelli’s view may be more modern in politics than suggested. This is the ancient custom he incites throughout The prince, of comparing humans with animals, and stating how adaptability of these is a leadership priority (Machiavelli's The Prince, part 7: the two sides of human nature | Nick Spencer, 2020). Earlier I touched upon the view of fighting with force as a beastly attribute. Other animalistic features significant for a prince to \"draw on both natures\" are the strength of a lion and cunningness of a fox (Machiavelli, 2020). Although the concept of human and animal nature being used metaphorically to describe an ideal or reality is ancient, the emphasis that the two natures, act as resources to portray different qualities, is what brings success in a leader, is an observation we can make today. The frequent use of verbs like, ‘adopt’, ‘employ’ ‘disguise’ and ‘change’ connote a reassurance that leaders must only use these animalistic qualities on a temporary and fluctuating basis. Adaptability and flexibility, not essentially prescribed in the essence of brute animal nature, are still key qualities a leader needs for success, because in ones duration of power, society adapts with new challenges that arise, of which leadership must respond to and will do so by adaptation. A close example to show the failure of adaptation and consequent weak leadership is, Brexit. David Cameron’s departure, after the referendum result suggests he had no capability as well as willingness to adhere to such change. Likewise, Theresa May’s catastrophic turn of events during the withdrawal process, represented by her internal government unpopularity, suggests how she was unable to instil a \"strong and stable\" leadership. <nl>Overall, we can use Machiavelli’s basic suggestion that in politics, it is not always rational to be moral, as a way of understanding the nature of the modern state, but must remember to recognise this in the light of different types of morality. His emphasis on power is valid when contemplating what will bring a prince the ultimate amount of success and his idealist thoughts on the judgement by ethical standards is permissible because there has and always will be a prevalent distinction reflected in politics. His view of human nature, however, is not useful as guidance in understanding how the state should be structured, as if followed will lead to a dismal and detrimental society, shaped by our own pessimistic cultures. We have seen that social contract theorists offer a much more pleasant view of human nature, so if we truly wanted to live in a harmonious state, that was successful in all key characteristics than we should look more to the philosophy of Rousseau.", "t tea now?<new>What mug<new>Also do you want decaf or normal<new>Oat milk too?<new>Ok<new>How many sweetener<new>?<new>Ok<new>Won’t let me add it<new>On phone or computer<new>A long time due to the fact that the wax was all over the side and stuck to the box therefore I’ve had to unstick it and clean it up<new>I think my hands are demolished<new>Is the fat cat in your room?<new>In your room somewhere<new>Behind the pillow I think<new>Ok<new>Yh just about <subject><new>Where’s <pers_FN>?<new>Yh<new>Later his blood test<new>I transferred you the £15 I borrowed for <pers_FN><new>Take it out by <location>"]}

{"id": "6b021077-152a-4040-8404-7052f2a94a23", "discourse_types": ["essay", "text_message"], "pair": ["Johns Case: <nl>John is an 18-year-old male university student living by himself, diagnosed with Atopic Dermatitis (AD) as a baby and Asthma at the age of 5 following a respiratory infection. He is prescribed preventer and reliever inhalers for his asthma. He is currently having respiratory issues such as wheezing, coughing and difficulty breathing which becomes more apparent during rugby. He reports trouble sleeping, anxiety and stress and feeling depressed, making studies become a struggle and he currently copes by distracting himself and is thinking about quitting university and moving back home. John experienced an asthma attack recently too which has led to his self-isolation behaviour due to feeling embarrassed. From my understanding his flareups in both conditions have become severe noted by the effect on his life, without control over his conditions his stress has turned chronic which signifies an impaired hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (Dhabhar, 2006; Guilliams &amp; Edwards, 2010).<nl><nl>Quality of life &amp; Mental Health: <nl>John’s quality of life (QOL) and mental health are intertwined, and they have both recently plummeted, every aspect of John’s daily life is affected. The association of asthmaAD and poor QOL is well notarised (Holm et al, 2006; Hossny et al, 2017; Miadich et al, 2015; Stucky et al,2015). Quality of life can be defined as ability to perform everyday activities and satisfaction with levels of functioning and control of diseaserelated symptoms with regards to physical, psychological and social well-being (Gotay &amp; Moore, 1992).<nl>Arguably the biggest QOL issue is his lack of sleep due to trouble breathing and itching symptoms from AD. Research has shown experiences of sleep disturbances are significantly associated with uncontrolled asthma and AD severity, exactly like john’s case (Jeon et al, 2017; Sundbom et al, 2018). Sleep is essential for energy and cognitive recovery, memory consolidation, muscle recovery and without sufficient sleep you are at a heightened risk of depressive disorders and even psychosis (Nutt et al, 2008; Walker, 2017; Waters et al, 2018). The lack of sleep may account for Johns experiences as he struggles with studies and he reports finding it difficult to look after himself by which we could infer to mean eating properly, basic hygiene andor managing his AD all of which would need the energy to do so.<nl>John’s decreased QOL can also be noted in rugby as he mentions he is out of breath quickly and his recent experience of an asthma attack; this follows trend with research as although exercise can be effective in asthma control and improving lung function this is only under circumstances of aerobic training not in the circumstance of rugbysports which can be actually asthma inducing like it is with John (Hansen et al, 2020; Kojima et al, 2009). Not only is John not enjoying it due to the troubles he is having, but it may be a contributing factor to his asthma getting worse. Although, the research for exercise induced asthma looked at children aged 6-14years which is a big gap in development to John. But the idea of induced asthma is supported by Del-Giacco et al (2015), who reports breathlessness a common occurrence in endurance sports like rugby and impairments are negated only when asthma is controlled, but John is not controlling his. We can infer from the research that John is playing rugby at a high intensity as low-moderate intensity can conversely reduce asthmatic inflammation (Hossny et al, 2017).<nl>As for mental health, John is experiencing an averse psychological state, he reports stress about university, living away from home and struggling to play rugby. Stress is naturally placed given his circumstances, research shows exam periods induce stress in asthmatic students, leading to increased inflammation via bronchoconstriction (Liu et al, 2002). Although this study had a small sample of only 20 participants, it is supported through literature like Kullowatz et al (2008),  who reports stress reduces lung function directly. Furthermore, Johns AD flareups are supplementary to additional stress in what is known as the itch-scratch cycle, AD can be triggeredenhanced due to corticotropin-releasing hormones and mast cells from stressing and likewise AD itself is then inducing flareups by altering the skin barrier making John feel more stressed (Arck &amp; Paus, 2006; Arndt et al, 2008).<nl><nl>John is affected by feelings of anxiousness and worry too, about his time management and exam performance. Exam anxiety is a common experience for many, and research has found 20-25% of college students experience it (Ergene, 2003; Thomas et al, 2017). However, that being said, John’s feelings of anxiety and worry are likely exacerbated given his conditions, research shows AD is likely to generate anxiety due to itching and perceived social stigmatisation (Chrostowska-Plak et al, 2012). Likewise, there are strong significant associations between asthma and anxiety disorderscurrent anxiety (Del-Giacco et al, 2016). Despite this, an issue in the latter study is that in half the cases anxiety preceded asthma, we cannot comment on whether Johns anxiety is caused by his asthma becoming severe nor on whether he has developed an anxiety disorder or if he is simply just feeling anxiousness currently. <nl>John is also experiencing depressive mood; this is highly predictive from intensity of daily stressors and research has found anxiety disorders have 20-40% co-morbidity overlap with depressive disorders (D’Angelo &amp; Wiekzbicki, 2003; Huppert, 2008). But likewise, with points above without standardised measurements we cannot say whether John meets the criteria for mood disorder diagnoses. Alongside these correlations, Johns conditions themselves are associated with low mooddepressive symptoms (Kim et al, 2015; Zielinksi et al, 2000) .The sample in the study for AD being especially noteworthy, having used matched control participants and finding significance whilst controlling for many lifestyle variables. In summation, both literature and the case study signal an issue of low, depressive mood.<nl><nl>Coping:<nl>John reports coping by suppressing thoughts and distracting himself with TV and videogames. Considering the perspective of the transactional model of stress and coping, it seems John on the contrary is not  actually ‘coping’ as noted by his reports of him stressing instead (Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1987). His behaviour itself is anxiety based and would be deemed mal-adaptive, he is directly avoiding his problems via distractions and doing so this may also play a part in further stress generation as noted by Holahan et al (2005). Not only is the avoidance increasing Johns difficulties but so is his attempt to suppress his thoughts, research shows that suppressing thoughts does change your expressive behaviour but does not affect your emotional experience (Cutuli, 2014). Johns attempt to cope only gets worse as in the case study it mentions him wanting to quit  university and move back home, this signifies a deeper plunge into avoidance.<nl>In theorising why John is primarily using avoidance and suppression, we can infer two things, that John believes he has no control over his situationconditions, as reported earlier John is actively isolating himself and needs social support. Humphreys et al (2011) found via focus groups that those with asthma, centralised coping on social support rather than controlling their symptoms, however john has moved out and does not have his mom to be his social support anymore and is self-isolating from friends. We infer he is dealing with feelings of helplessness as a result of not being able to cope his normal way. The idea of helplessness is not a new idea in johns’ case, a report on AD specifically found feelings of helplessness and also anxious-depressive mood which can be seen with John (Schut et al, 2014). <nl><nl>Interventions:<nl>The psychological path to solving Johns intricate case of mental and physical health issues cannot deny the invaluable significance of medication found for both asthma and AD (Atherton, 2003; Ram et al, 2001). Furthermore, even accounting the sheer variance of psychological therapies, psychology has come up with limited evidence to treat physical symptoms of asthma and  has  little to no ability in changing medication adherence as noted by meta analyses, psychology as a standalone will be ineffective to treat Johns physical symptoms from asthma (Nieuwlaat et al, 2014;Smith &amp; Jones, 2015). However, for AD there is significant findings of the effect of psychology therapy such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) on severity, itching intensity and scratching (Chida et al, 2007).<nl>Albeit the best recommendation is for a multidisciplinary approach to Johns case supported by research in asthma-related hospital admissions and management of AD (Burke et al, 2016; LeBovidge et al, 2016). Whereby John receives 5-9 1hourweekly CBT sessions for his anxiety, stress, and AD from us, research has found significant improvements in asthma specific QOL, stress and depression (Parry et al, 2012; Grover et al, 2007). Furthermore, given improvements in all those dimensions we can expect anxiety to reduce in correlation <nl>The other parts of the multidisciplinary team could support him via social care for isolation and medication via allergygp services. Lastly, it may also be informative for John to be told about options of digital SMS interventions for example where he would receive a text to remind him to take his preventer inhaler, found to improve medication adherence (Chan et al, 2018).", "got 1.6k awards😭😭😭thats more than our portfolios combined and doubled in price<new>Mut wake me at 12<new>We got work to do<new>Wake me up if gme is above 400 or below 130<new>^ if its above 250<new>Got 4hr resource booster from login lol<new>Found 8 argons in 5mins😂😂<new>And got enough plastids to make wukong now<new>Also free rhino skin next month for 8yr anniversary<new>That is weird<new>Inv me<new>And try<new>Lol got resource booster 4 hrs on daily login<new>If ur doing higher volumes its only £1 fee<new>And zero spread<new>Ye thats minor<new>Only whilst market is this rocked"]}

{"id": "bff80304-231e-40d9-9bc0-5b97c79e919a", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Rationale:<nl>The research topic I am looking at links to the use of social media and what the possible consequences are, I chose to study this topic due to the wide use of social media and how much it has taken over what we do and how we live our lives. Social media is used in many ways such as for business purposes, marketing, cultural exchanges, news sources, etc. Most people in today’s society have access to at least a minimum of one social media platform due to the increased popularity in social networking, especially in the younger generation, but my research aims to look at how this may affect an individual. According to a survey conducted in 2018 by common sense media, 40% of teenagers aged between 13-17 claimed that keeping in contact with friends on social media daily is either \"extremely\" or \"very\" important. The main research question I am looking at is what is the impact of social media on an individual’s self-perception and relationship? This will be done by conducting a semi-structured interview, with the interview schedule being in the appendices, showing the development built from the main question. This includes the effects of social media for friendships relationships and families, how mental health can be damaged and looking at whether social media is seen as healthy or not. The method of analysis I have chosen for this research topic is discourse analysis, this is the most appropriate method, for the study I am conducting, as I am investigating the perception of social media and getting a better understanding at the individual’s views of social media rather than their life experiences. The name of the participant I interviewed will not be used to protect confidentiality, so I used the pseudonym Eliza. <nl><nl>Results:<nl><nl>Discourse 1- negativity of social media<nl>Eliza understands how much social media is used and how it does cause problems despite her lack of use of social media \"I rarely use social media\". Eliza portrays the discursive object as social media and the discourse of social media being negative. Eliza knows that social media is constantly being used and that people on social media may behave inappropriately leading to serious consequences. She understands the effects it can have on a person and the reason why people may behave this way. <nl><nl><data_extract><nl> <nl>Eliza realises that on social media people can act in a way that is not the same as how they behave in real life, but their actions can ultimately hurt the people they love. She explores that people use social media in the wrong way knowing that what they are doing is wrong however some people also get treated bad on social media for no reason and this can affect an individual due to increase of negativity. <nl><nl><data_extract><nl><nl>Eliza points out that not only does negativity affect communication between people but also interferes with how an individual feels about themselves, particularly through cyber-bullying which can destroy how someone might feel about themselves and make them feel low, therefore affecting how they behave. <nl><nl>Discourse 2- vital for families<nl>Eliza does share the good things of social media being that it helps keep people in connection with each other, mainly with families. Despite the risk of suffering bullying or negativity, some people may just use social media just as a form of contact to those they cannot get a reach of often or see in person.<nl><nl><data_extract><nl><nl>Eliza explains how social media is very beneficial to socialise for the right reasons to the right people, this is a common reason for Eliza using social media herself, to be able to interact with family and keep a strong bond from members of her family she might not see very often. This shows that although social media might not be a safe place, it does have positives for bringing people together and can in some ways create a stronger community amongst people. <nl><nl><data_extract><nl><nl>Eliza then goes on to discuss how social media can be a disadvantage with family members who might not allow freedom whilst on social media and watch over what they are doing, causing dispute between people. This is obviously seen as a disadvantage as people in the younger generation especially do not want to be supervised on what they do and who they talk to by relatives however, in other ways this can be seen as a good thing as by having family members on social media, this should stop people from posting something that may be inappropriate or offensive as parents can watch what their children are doing online. Eliza then goes on to talk about reputation and states \"oh, wait and also you might post things that goes against families\", this can vary between posting something that can go against religion, can be a hateful comment such as homophobia or a revealing picture that parents would not want other people seeing. This would therefore cause strains and arguments between family members as parents may try and be controlling but children may want some space for themselves. <nl><nl>Discourse 3- loneliness <nl>Eliza shared her thoughts on whether people who use social media tend to be lonely or not. She explained that is it common for people to use social media for company and may even talk to someone that they have not met before in real life. <nl><nl><data_extract><nl><nl>She claims that people do talk to people on social media due to lack in confidence in making friends which is becoming a problem for children as they might start to rely on talking to people online and causing them to lack the right skills to communicate with people in real life. She also mentions that people do it to make themselves feel better and more appreciated by having someone talk to them in a friendly manner. This goes against the points of being cyber-bullied showing that some people who might get bullied in real life rely on people on the internet to keep then happy. Eliza did suggest that not everyone uses social media due to feeling lonely but might use it because they could potentially be bored or still require more attention and people to talk to. Some people do have enough friends and families in their lives to talk to often but might get bored and want to use social media rather than actually feeling lonely.<nl><nl>Discourse 4- social media not healthy<nl>Eliza justified that social media can be healthy in some ways but may also be unhealthy and gave her views for both sides leading a balanced answer. She claimed that a lot of people use social media just for attention and to get people to start to notice them more which also makes them feel better and improve their self-esteem but in the wrong ways<nl><nl><data_extract><nl><nl>Eliza goes on to contradict herself by then saying it is healthy as individuals could use social media to seek help and people will reply to them in a way that makes them feel better. Some people find it easier to talk on social media and if that is their way of making themselves happier than it is being used in a healthy manner. Eliza basically claims that it is the mindset we have for using social media, some people use it to be needy and have people feel sorry for them and that is not a healthy way of using social media however Eliza thinks that letting out your problems is healthy when people do it to genuinely speak their mind and helps them to feel relieved.<nl><nl>Discussion:<nl>Eliza showed moments throughout the interview where she is against the use of social media and does not agree with how it is being used these days however, she also realises the importance of it. Through experience she realised that talking to family through social media is a great phenomenon which makes her feel content, she also brought on the fact that people who may need more support use social media widely to gain that support so can make people feel better. A study done in 2003 by Janet Morahan-Martin shows that individuals that are lonelier tend to use social media more for companionship and intimacy especially compared to those who are not so much lonely.<nl>Eliza shows the different people on social media who can either improve the well-being of an individual or make it worse depending on the type of person who uses social media. Some people care about individuals and do feel sincere about those who are troubled, and then some people feel joy about intimidating others through social media and have no guilt to tear apart friendships or relationships making social media an unsafe place. With the final discourse about whether social media is healthy or not, Eliza managed to show both points of views on whether it is accepted and beneficial or whether there are consequences, she stated it should only be used for the purposes of seeking help from anyone online and to relieve whatever pain, sadness or emotion they are feeling.

{"id": "f4ff24da-bb8f-424d-bb4b-d38cfc0d2f37", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["This strategy paper will focus on suggesting realistic solutions to the problem of educational gender inequality in India. This inequality is a clear problem; unequal access to education is an infringement of human rights. If this gender disparity was lessened, the well-being and development of children would be positively impacted, as well as the economy of the country itself (Fuller, 2019). To tackle this issue, proposed strategies could take the form of implementing new legislative reforms that aid families in the struggles they face, as well as reforming teaching throughout India in order to help eradicate damaging cultural and social norms. The paper will begin by firstly explaining the main problems within the education sector in India and will then highlight the importance of achieving gender equality in education. The main body of the paper will entail a detailed analysis of the current strategies and legislation in place as well as non-governmental reforms made by different organisations. The paper will then move towards a focus on the suggested strategies that could be incorporated into the current education system to alleviate gender inequalities and will be compared to the successes of educational reform in Sweden. This will include a description of the targets for the reforms, instruments to aid reform, and the target groups at which reforms are aimed at. The paper will conclude with a summary of the findings from this research and ways to ensure the successful implementation of new strategies.  <nl>Why is this a problem?<nl>There are two primary factors that can limit the education of girls in India: cultural traditions and poverty. In terms of cultural traditions, there are several reasons that this issue can play a significant role in the educational disparity between genders. Firstly, the miseducation of parents about the importance of schools for girls and the costings of education itself thus leads to families becoming reluctant to educate girls within the household. Research shows that parents are more willing to send their girls to school if they had access to more information about school (Maertens, 2011). Furthermore, it is said that gender discrimination within household expenditure and education has resulted in the inadequate progress of educating of women in many countries across the world, and thus ingrains this issue into the societal framework of such countries (Saha, 2013). This is also reinforced by the low literacy rates in India. The correlation between low literacy rates among men and women indicates that the miseducation of parents can affect the education of girls because they themselves have had inadequate education, and it is difficult for them to understand the importance of it, further highlighting the gender inequalities between men and women through previous social norms. For example, the 2011 literacy rates of women were 57.93% compared to men which were 77.15% (Pathania, 2020) demonstrating gender disparities and how poverty can be a factor in gender inequalities within education. Poverty plays an important role in the lack of education for girls. Daughters from families that face social pressures to get married are more likely to only complete minimum education, as shown in a study of three rural villages in India, where only 39% of girls were allowed by their parents to pursue higher education, compared to the 71% of boys who would go into further education (Maertens, 2013). Furthermore, educating women is not prioritised in the household as it stops the income that would otherwise be earned from girls going straight into work rather than staying in school. Therefore, working and earning can be seen to be put on a pedestal instead for the many families facing financial difficulties (Hebert, 2020).<nl>Why is this an important issue for gender equality?<nl>As UNICEF has stated, the educational advancement of girls is the most effective way of combatting challenges to human development, so it is important to expand educational access and overcome cultural norms to achieve this (Ross, Shah &amp; Wang, 2011). Inequalities within education are important to the issue of gender equality, as even though India emerges as one of the top three countries for higher education (Bazaz &amp; Akram, 2020), in certain states such as Uttar Pradesh, only 33.20% of women are educated compared to the 73.40% of men who are educated, highlighting that there are severe problems within the education system that disadvantage women. Furthermore, this can lead to other problems such as a gender gap in the labour market, as if employers value a woman’s education less than that of a man’s, and therefore there are fewer economic incentives to educate women, which subsequently affects the economy and the wellbeing of women (Rammohan &amp; Vu, 2018). Another factor that makes this issue important is that the education of girls further reduces the risks they face, such as abuse and child marriage, as currently, a third of child brides worldwide are in India (Sahni, 2018). Moreover, better education for girls reduces the risks of child labour in poorer families to ensure the survival of their households, as the hourly wages of a child with higher school education are 8.97% higher compared to a child with no schooling, leading to less exploitation (Chamarbagwala, 2008). <nl>Attempted strategies to achieve gender equality in education<nl>There have been many attempts in India to close the gender gaps in education, through both legal and social means. The main legislative reform introduced was the Right to Education Act in 2009, in which, all children between 6 and 14 years of age are required to complete primary school education. This reform has proven successful as enrolment between 2013-14 increased from 43.8% to 48.2% (Sahni, 2018). However, its success still proves limited on the gender equality front as a UNESCO report detailed that of the 95% of children who attended primary school, only 40% continued onto secondary education, in which, a small fraction of the 40% were girls (Modi, 2017). Attempts have also been made to reform the curriculum. However, this failed due to the response of disadvantaged schools towards the issue of gender equality: an attempt was made to create a new system where boys of different abilities were paired with girls, but this meant the educational interests of girls were sacrificed, therefore showing little to no development in changing gender inequalities in schools (Charlton, 2007).<nl>Secondly, a non-legislative reform that was made to combat gender inequality in education was the KGBV programme introduced in 2004. The goal of the programme was to increase children’s, and in particular girls, access to the curriculum and to improve teaching standards. This began successfully as two Indian states partnered with CARE India (a non-governmental organisation) to introduce KGBV schools that were single-sex and employ a non-traditional curriculum. The KGBV school initiative was shown to be successful as they were more inclusive than state schools, as children of all castes could attend, which also allowed the new schools challenged harmful social norms. However, the success was limited as the KGBV programme did not focus on education above seventh grade where school dropout rates for girls are the highest (Shah, 2015).<nl>Finally, the most successful attempt at improving gender inequality in education was by ANK, a non-profit organisation with an aim to empower girls. ANK set up in 10 rural villages and introduced several initiatives for girls including: bicycle banks in 2002 to improve access to schools for girls, a life skills education programme out of school hours, a scholarship programme, and a karate programme. The implementation of these programmes showed great promise as 1,100 girls achieved a scholarship and 1,000 girls were given access to bikes. It was found that the combination of the bicycle bank and the life skills education programme led to the best education outcomes for girls. However, the bicycle bank programme was discontinued and this programme only reached a small number of girls, so, nationally, gender disparities remained high (Modi, 2017).<nl>Proposed Strategies<nl>My first proposed strategy is to subsidise costs for school by 50% for low-income families; as mentioned above, many parents selectively choose their male children to attend school rather than their female children, because of financial difficulties. Therefore, subsidising the costs of schooling can enable equal opportunities for girls. This has proved successful in countries such as Sweden, where pre-schooling costs have been subsidised for lower-income families, in order to equalise opportunities for all and ensure substantial educational attainment for both males and females (Bjorklund, Clark, Edin, Fredricksson &amp; Krueger, 2006). Success can be seen clearly when compared to India, a large 79% of the students go on to secondary school in Sweden (European Commission, 2017) against a mere 40% in India, in which, the ratio of boys to girls is equal in Sweden unlike in India (Modi, 2017).<nl>Additionally, another legislative reform that could be introduced is to improve families’ access to daycare and after school care, so that parents can work, alleviating any stresses on children providing additional household income. A similar policy proved successful in Sweden (Sweden, 2020), in which a right to daycare was introduced in the 1990s for working parents to alleviate financial pressure (Fritzell, Hvinden, Kautto, Kvist &amp; Uusitalo, 2001). Furthermore, there has been evidence to suggest that altering the way teachers are trained helps to promote gender equality and eradicate bias in the classroom. In a proposed system called REFLECT, teachers are given criteria that they must meet, including creating a suitable learning environment for female and male children - this could prove beneficial in India (Kollmayer, 2020).<nl>The next proposed strategy is an extension of the work of ANK with the bicycle banks and life skills education programme (Modi, 2017) as it proved successful but stopped due to a lack of funding. This would enable a focus on the education of girls and give them access to adequate teaching, which in turn reaps enormous benefits economically, socially, and mentally, especially in terms of the wellbeing of girls in India. It would also help to elevate the goal of India to become more gender-inclusive, as currently, their progress for gender equality remains slow and they stand at a ranking of 132 out of 187 countries (Rammohan &amp; Vu, 2018). Sequentially, to enable parents of girls to realise the importance of education, it is vital to recruit them as allies in the movement against gender inequalities in education. To do this, parents’ evenings could be introduced for teachers to educate parents in schooling and other matters that put girls at risk such as child marriage. Research shows that parents evenings are important in the development of a child and important for the parents themselves as they are responsible for making key decisions that impact the future of their children (Fefer, 2020), highlighting how this can also be a way to communicate the positive prospects for girls with the aid of education. <nl>To conclude, it is prevalent that actions must be taken within education legislation and within the households of girls to combat the problem of gender inequality within education. The government must take steps to support families of lower incomes so as to ensure no one is denied equal opportunity to education. This will reduce child labour rates, increase literacy rates, and improve India’s ranking on the gender equality index, as well as increasing the economic status of many civilians in India. With the increased education of girls, it will help to combat harmful social norms in the future, preventing young girls from the fate of child marriage, abuse, and exploitation. With reforms in teaching, they could allow for long-lasting changes within education, as it means they can be the main drivers for change within schools. This, combined with the added aid of regular parents’ evenings, allows for teachers to become catalysts in changing negative social attitudes towards gender equality concerns that strategies like these will remain only partially effective. For example, India was one of 52 countries that refused to comply with Article 5 of the UN sustainable development goals which states that \"to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls\" (United Nations, 2020). Without the support of the government, gender equality may not be valued. However, this can be counteracted by the implementation and enforcement of new laws, starting within the education sector, to allow women and young girls to become more independent and assert themselves within society.", "<addr3_FN>, <nl> <nl>What is the latest time that I can send a draft to you today? :) <nl> <nl>Kind Regards, <nl><nl><part_FN_SN><new>Hi <addr3_FN>, <nl> <nl>I already know that this isn't great because it has been rushed but here is a draft of my literature review.<nl> <nl>Kind RegardsBeste Grüße<nl> <nl><nl><part_FN_SN><nl><new>Hi <addr3_FN>, <nl> <nl>Thank you for the feedback, it is very helpful.<nl> <nl>I have just been looking at the template on <system> for the proposal as there is no conclusion, it just ends with a methodology.

In this study, participants were presented with words of colours and were asked to respond to the font colour. The words either matched their font colour (congruent) or were dissimilar to their font colour (incongruent). Their reaction time was measured in milliseconds (ms) across 60 trials and comparisons were drawn between the two conditions. The mean reaction time was 878.8ms for the congruent condition and 966.8ms for incongruent. This difference is significant.<nl><nl>Introduction<nl>When performing the classic Stroop task, participants were asked to identify the colour of a printed word and ignore its meaning (Entel &amp; Tzelgov, 2018). The Stroop effect occurs when the written word (\"blue\") is printed in a non-matching font colour (red) which delays reaction time. The stimuli (words) are incongruent and reaction time is affected by the automatic cognitive process of reading words. (Stroop, 1935; Braisby &amp; Gellatly, 2012; Grondin, 2016). <nl>Previous research has suggested that incongruent stimuli delays reaction times than congruent stimuli. There is literature that suggests that this is a consistent effect. <nl>Stroop (1935) compared the difference in time for reading words printed in black and coloured ink (2.3 seconds) then the difference in naming colours of the squares and font colour (47.0 seconds). <nl><figure><nl><nl>Results from Stroop (1935) showed that reaction times slowed, by an average 110.3 seconds (Goodwin, 2010), when the font colour was different from the meaning of the word (for example, when ‘red’ was written in yellow ink) in comparison to naming the word in colour (43.3 seconds) - 67 seconds difference.<nl><figure><nl>Other studies have also shown this effect such as Datta, Nebhinani &amp; Dixit (2019). Datta et al. (2019) compared the difference in reaction times in three conditions (neutral, congruent and incongruent). The incongruent condition (condition 3), had participants reacting to both Hindi and English versions of the Stroop task where the words were written in both English and Hindi. The incongruent condition meant the name of the colour-word did not match with the font colour (Datta et al., 2019). The study had 42 participants and each condition of each language had 48 trials.<nl>Results from Datta et al. (2019) showed a mean of 1051.93 milliseconds (ms) in the English version incongruent condition which was 54.8 ms slower than the Hindi version in condition 3 (997.13 ms) and 151.63 ms slower when comparing to the English version in Condition 2 (900.30 ms).<nl>These researchers found that incongruent trials took longer to respond to than congruent trials, therefore the prediction for this study was that students would take longer to react to stimuli in the incongruent condition than reacting to stimuli in the congruent condition.<nl><nl>Method<nl>Design<nl>The experiment used a repeated measures design. The independent variable was congruency with two levels - incongruent and congruent. The dependent variable was reaction time measured in milliseconds.<nl><nl>Participants<nl>Overall, there were 59 participants. All were Psychology Undergraduate students from Aston University and a volunteer sample, recruited through University comms.<nl><nl>Apparatus and Materials<nl>Participants used personal computers to complete the experiment. This study used PsychoPy to collect data – an experimental software which recorded participants reaction time. <nl>The words used were ‘Red’, ‘Green’, and ‘Blue’ (See Figure. 3, Figure. 4 and Figure. 5). The font used was Arial, with the stimuli positioned in the centre of the screen at (0,0). The response options were keyboard arrow keys, left for ‘red’ ink, up for ‘green’ and right for ‘blue’. There were 10 reps to each 6 stimulus types, totalling 60 trials in blocks of 10.<nl><figure><nl>Procedure<nl>Participants gave consent to participate in the study and took part in the experiment individually.<nl>At the beginning of the experiment, participants received written instructions on their monitor. Participants read the instructions in their own time before pressing an arrow on the keyboard to begin the experiment. The instructions described what the participants were to do and which keys they would need to use to respond to the stimuli. (See Appendix 1 for full instructions.).<nl>The stimuli were presented on the computer in a random sequence, the words appearing singularly, on the monitor, centre-screen, and only disappearing when participants pressed an accepted key. The experiment ended when all 60 trials were completed.<nl><nl>Results <nl><table><nl>Table 1 shows that mean reaction times were longer in the colour incongruent than colour congruent condition. Both SDs are high relative to the mean, this suggests the data may not be reliable as there are large within condition differences.

This suggests that reaction time was affected by the automatic cognitive process of reading words when attempting to react to the colour (Stroop, 1935; Braisby et al. 2012; Grondin, 2016; MacLeod, 1991). Cohen, Dunbar &amp; McClelland (1990) would suggest that this also illustrates the way people process information and people’s capacity for selective attention.<nl><nl>Methodological Issues<nl>Due to the way the experiment was ran, participants completed the study not in a standardised environment, completing the study on the different computers or PCs in dissimilar environments.

This is because the implementation of good faith towards commercial contracts is detrimental to the core principles and values commercial law prides itself upon. The principles which commercial law prides itself upon are: commercial certainty and party autonomy. If good faith is applied to commercial law, it affects both of these principles in some way, shape or form. Therefore, England’s commercial law courts will fall behind its competitors as the implementation of good faith may be detrimental to the highly acclaimed courts. This essay will show how the implementation of good faith will undermine these core principles.<nl>How good faith affects party autonomy.<nl>What is good faith?<nl>Good faith is defined as ‘a standard of conduct characterised by honesty, openness and consideration for the interests of the other party to the transaction or relationship in question’. Good faith can be included in a contract either expressly or it can be implied. If parties agree to deal with good faith and this is included in the final contract it will be enforceable, however it is not always this straight forward. Good faith can also be included through implied terms in a contract. The parties need to fulfil certain criteria to allow good faith to be implied in the contract. These criteria include: there must be no express terms of good faith, high degree of communication and cooperation, long standing commercial relationships, etc. <nl>To further develop this there are two types of implied terms; those implied by fact or those implied by law. ‘Terms implied by fact are those that a court will read into a contract so that it reflects the intention of the parties.’. ‘Terms implied in law are not terms that the parties to an agreement would have agreed to, but rather terms that arise as a legal incident of a particular legal relationship’.<nl><nl>What is party autonomy?<nl>Simply put party autonomy allows the parties, that are contracting with one another, to choose which laws will govern the contract between them. This in essence allows ‘commercial men to do business in the way they want to do it’ which was said by Lord Devlin.<nl>Party autonomy then gives rise to two more legal concepts which are freedom of contract and sanctity of contract. These two principles are used in court to enforce party autonomy. The definition of freedom of contract is ‘The parties are free to agree the terms of the contract that will govern their relationship’. This means that the business men will decide which rules they want to apply in their contract and the court will uphold this. Sanctity of contract is when ‘the courts should give eﬀect to the terms of the contract and should not be quick to invalidate contractual terms freely entered into. Accordingly, the courts will seek to uphold commercial contracts, unless the terms are overly restrictive or oppressive, are in breach of the law, or oﬀend principles of public policy.’. <nl>Party autonomy is extremely important to English commercial law, ‘despite statutory inroads, party autonomy is at the heart of English commercial law’. It can be seen as the heart of English commercial law as it allows business men to contract how they wish, allowing parties to conduct the arbitral process as they desire. Therefore, if good faith limits or alters the application of party autonomy it could be very detrimental to English commercial law. This will be discussed further.<nl>How implied terms of good faith affect party autonomy.<nl>The basis of party autonomy is to allow the contracting parties to decide what governs their contract. If the contracting parties wanted to include aspects of good faith within the contract, then they would have expressly included it within the contract. The implication of allowing implied terms to govern commercial contracts is that the parties no longer have as much control of what governs the contract. The parties include the terms that they see fit to apply to the contract. Therefore, if the court looked at the contract on surrounding circumstances and applied good faith which they did not intend to include into the contract, it would undermine the principle of party autonomy. <nl>The case of Yam Seng Leggat said ‘the relevant background against which contracts are made includes not only matters of fact known to the parties but also shared values and norms of behaviour’. Since the terms are not expressed there is no clarity and so a level of uncertainty exists when interpreting the circumstances surrounding the contracting parties. Since the contracting parties have no control over this, it directly affects party autonomy, ‘the \"\"implied\"\" duty of good faith that would undermine the terms the parties have seen fit to reduce to writing.’. The fact that the contracting parties exclude certain terms of good faith from the contract shows that this would be because they did not come to a proper agreement upon certain terms ‘the very fact that the parties have excluded from the text of the contract some specifications that were discussed during the negotiations indicates that no agreement was reached on those matters.’. Therefore, why should these terms of good faith be included if they could not agree upon them, hence why it would not be included into the contract. So why should the courts then say they implied these principles while drafting the contract and then apply them. If this were true it would have been drafted into the contract originally. Therefore, implied terms of good faith negatively affect party autonomy. <nl>How express terms of good faith affect party autonomy.<nl>On the surface express terms of good faith may seem to enhance party autonomy. This is because if the contracting parties want the law of good faith to apply, they can put it in writing as an express term. If they do this the court will enforce it. In the case of Petromec Inc v Petroleo Brasileiro SA Petrobras the contracting parties included a promise in the contract to negotiate in good faith. Since they had an express term of good faith within the contract, the courts could enforce the duty of good faith upon the party. Therefore, enhancing party autonomy as the contracting parties wanted the law of good faith to apply to the contract. ‘Party autonomy is enhanced by the Courts recognising and giving effect to the parties pre-contractual intentions’. <nl>However, express terms of good faith can be seen as more detrimental to party autonomy than beneficial. This is because good faith is a very loose term and thus creates uncertainty. ‘with it comes great uncertainty as to scope of the obligation and trying to determine the meaning of such duty, and its interaction with the other terms of the agreement’ the parties may want to include terms of good faith but they may be too vague in order to be enforceable in the contract. Therefore, party autonomy is affected as the desired laws may not be applied. ‘Even when a document…is intended by the parties to be legally binding, there are circumstances in which it may be regarded as too uncertain to be enforceable by a court.’. Also when applying express terms of good faith if they are not explicitly stating what the duty of good faith is it leads to uncertainty. This could lead the courts to interpret good faith in a way that neither party anticipated. Therefore, directly undermining party autonomy. <nl>How does good faith undermine commercial certainty?<nl>What is commercial certainty?<nl>Commercial certainty put simply is the ‘predictability of judicial decisions’. Commercial certainty in English commercial law is a major selling point as it is clear where the contracting parties stand in relation to the law when forming a contract ‘The law must be accessible and so far as possible intelligible, clear and predictable’. This is because the contracting parties contract off the precedent of past case law. Therefore, the contracting parties can anticipate and be certain of duties, responsibility and liability if needed. Therefore, once a rule has been decided parties will contract based upon this rule, so they will be certain that a similar outcome would occur. <nl>How does good faith affect commercial certainty?<nl>Implied terms of Good faith undermines commercial certainty due to the way in which good faith is applied within the courts. This is because the courts look at the surrounding circumstances such as the relationship between the parties etc. This can lead to uncertainty as the implementation of good faith can be vague and subjective. Good faith is very loosely defined which can lead to varying interpretations as to the meaning of good faith. Therefore the approach to applying good faith will be open to interpretation not giving consistency such as ‘ Is it the role of the courts to prescribe moral standards to which contractors must be judged by? It is subjective, in that ‘good faith’ only requires a clear conscience on behalf of both parties’. The danger is that the implementation and adjudication of good faith will be based upon ‘the basis of intuition, discretion or ad hoc decision-making rather than consistency’. <nl>This means in similar cases different outcomes could be reached, creating uncertainty in commercial law due to the application of good faith. If contracting parties enter a contract looking at precedent from a past case and they apply similar principles of implied good faith, they may not get the same outcome at court. This will cause uncertainty causing business men to contract elsewhere, as commercial certainty is essential to contracting parties. In Vallejo v Wheeler Lord Mansfield said ‘In all mercantile transactions the great object should be certainty; and therefore, it is of  more consequence that a rule should be certain, than whether the rule is established one way or the other. Because speculators in trade then know what ground to go upon’. Certainty is needed because the contracting parties want contracts to have strict performance so the contract can enforce the ultimate goals and intentions of the parties. Implied terms of good faith directly undermines commercial certainty as the contracting parties would not be sure of the outcome if they included implied terms of good faith into their contract. This shows that good faith is detrimental to commercial certainty, which commercial law prides itself upon. <nl>Conclusion.<nl>The general hostility to good faith as shown is extremely justified.  This is because good faith undermines the core principles of commercial law and will subsequently ruin the reputation of the English commercial courts, resulting in contracting parties to go elsewhere to contract with one another. If anything the English commercial courts could be seen as too lenient with the negative effects good faith is bringing to commercial law. These are not only short term problems with the contracting parties entering into contracts which are not suitable, but good faith is also destroying the core principles which commercial law is rested upon.<nl>Furthermore, party autonomy is not only a core principle of commercial law but also a major selling point to business men. This is because they can take control over their contracts, so they can fulfil the parties best interests without interference. However, good faith significantly reduces the freedom that these parties have. This is because implied terms of good faith may be applied through the courts even though it was neither of the parties intentions. Also with express terms of good faith there is very little clarity making it difficult to understand not only for the contracting parties but also for the courts. Therefore, good faith is attacking the very heart of commercial law.<nl>Finally, commercial certainty is another core principle on which commercial law is based upon. This unpredictability of cases will make contracting parties go to alternative places to proceed with dealings. This is because commercial certainty reassures and allows parties to contract with them knowing their commercial interests would be uninfringed upon. <nl>Therefore, English law has every right to have general hostility towards good faith. It could be argued that English law needs to be more hostile due to the damage good faith is doing towards commercial law.\"", "h Ik it’s just shit that <pers_FN> lives w him<new>Do you and <pers_FN> have a TV? and do u pay for the liscence<new>oh right so if I wanted to buy a TV just for watching stuff shall I just buy a monitor<new>That’s a shout<new>Do estate agents charge fees?

Various research has contributed to our understanding of the impact of parenting within child development, concerning parent rearing styles, socioeconomic background, alongside the demands which come with parenthood.  <nl>Research into parenting styles has helped in our understanding of parenting on child development, about investigating the relationship between the type of occupation depended on social class and parenting styles. As white-collar workers require the individual to deal more with the creative ideas, symbols, and interpersonal realities, whilst blue-collar workers are required to conform to external standards such as orderliness, neatness, and obedience (Gecas &amp; Nye, 1974; Kohn, 1969). From these contrasting two occupations research suggests that this essentially has influence in child-rearing styles to the child development concerning the socialisation of the child within society, alongside with their identity and values; as those of a lower-class may emphasise obedience and respect to authority to their children in comparison to middle-upper class parents who may encourage initiative, curiosity, and creativity to their child (Greenberger, O’Neil,&amp; Nagel, 1994).<nl>This research evidence can be perceived as reliable in contributing to our understanding of the indirect impact of parenting on child development, as various studies also support the notion of socioeconomic status influencing parenting and child development. This is evident as research shows that poor conditions within the workplace such as a busy day, high workload, and higher job demands are related to poor parenting behaviour (Repetti 1992, 1994). This is further supported by research by Repetti et al, (1991) which showed that fluctuations in job stressors experienced by male air traffic controllers contributed to the absence of the father, this consisted of fewer high involvement interactions and less monitoring and help with the children’s schoolwork.  Simultaneously, mothers with a variety of occupational status and heavy workloads also have less involvement and more withdrawal from children.<nl>Moreover, it can also be argued that this research aids in our understanding, as it does not have a bias about the role of father as solely a breadwinner but values the importance of father and child interaction in the development of the child. This non-traditional family approach to investigating the relationship between parenting and child development increases the mundane realism of the findings with today’s society with variations in family dynamics; especially with the consideration of the crucial role of the father in a child’s development.<nl>Baumrind's (1967) three patterns of parenting styles Authoritarian, Permissive, and Authoritative has contributed to our understanding of the impact of parenting on child development. Glasgow et al (1997) state that ‘Authoritarian parents are highly demanding and unresponsive’; this consists of the parent attempting to control and mould the behaviour of their children according to a set standard. This parenting style has increased our understanding with the supporting evidence which shows its effect on child development. As evidence shows that children from authoritarian families more prone to levels of perfectionism, critical attitudes, and anxiety (Randall, Bohner, &amp; Travers, 2015), alongside low academic achievement.  <nl>The second parenting style is authoritative parenting this consists of maintaining an effective balance between high levels of demandingness and responsiveness, alongside being warm and supportive parents. This style is found to be the most effective parenting style concerning school achievement. As a result of encouraging bidirectional communication between both the child and parent (Glasgow et al., 1997, p.508). In addition to this, the warm and affectionate relationship between children and parents promote cognitive growth in children (Maccoby &amp; Martin, 1983; Baumrind, 1973, 1979).<nl>The final parenting style is Permissive, this consists of a ‘more responsive than they are demanding approach’, therefore leading to little or no discipline for the child. This style has contributed to the impact of this parenting on child development. This is apparent within the findings of Sahithya, et al. (2020) which illustrated that a significant association with permissive parenting style and the sociability and emotionality of the child, alongside increased anxiety levels.<nl>These parenting styles can be seen as effective with the supporting evidence in regard to it touching all the spheres of the child development such as school achievement, mental health, and the socialisation the child, in comparison to adopting a narrow approach on child development such as the child’s behaviour alone.<nl>However, it can be argued that there is a cultural bias within the research of parenting styles with its influence on child development.  As cultures may perceive a parenting style as a more favourable and beneficial contribution to their child development; Authoritarian parenting in Asian cultures is perceived as more effective as they hold the belief that tough love leads to success (You &amp; Malley-Morrison 2000). Therefore, from this it can be argued that based upon various cultural viewpoints on parenting styles it will be difficult to see the impact of parenting styles within a child’s development as there appears to be no distinct correct style of parenting. <nl>Finally, it can also be argued that a parent’s mental health may also have influenced a child’s development. This is apparent based upon the difficulties that come with parenthood, such as sleep deprivation, finical stress, strained partner relationship (Nelson et al.,2014); essentially affecting the wellbeing of the parent affects the child’s development. This is further supported by Goodman et al, (2011) which found that there was an association between maternal depression and a child’s negative behaviour and psychopathology.  <nl>To conclude, it is evident that there is an association between parenting and child development, with the influence on parenting styles, the socio-economic status of the parent, alongside with the well-being of the parent. From these aspects it can be concluded that various aspects of the parent’s life solely have a direct and indirect effect on child development.

It is an argument including 2 premises and one conclusion without increasing semantic knowledge. An example for this would be \"All cats have fur. Fur is soft. Therefore, cats are soft\". The 2 premises here, are confirming the conclusion. Deductive reasoning holds strength (certainty and validity) whilst inductive reasoning depends on the certainty or strength of evidence. However, deductive reasoning can only be true is all premises are true and term are clear. <nl>In contrast, Inductive reasoning is an inferential process that expands knowledge on the face of uncertainty (Holland, Holyoak, Nisbett &amp; Thagard, 1986: p. 1). Inductive reasoning increases semantic knowledge which is used in 2 ways. Specific induction is a type of induction which generates explanations based on their background knowledge and therefore, create hypothesis. For example, if the kettle were shut, one would turn the switch on to start the kettle, from its worldly knowledge. However, general induction Is descriptive, it searches for an explanation via testing the hypothesis. For example, \"All kettles I have come across are electrical\" in which one would have to do research about to falsify it. In both examples, the conclusion can be proved wrong, as automatic kettles also exist. However, inductive reasoning can never be fully proven, it can only be invalidated.<nl>Regardless of all the differences between the two, they both happen work together in experimental projects.

{"id": "b7459070-5be2-4fdd-a933-cddfc5720463", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Georg Simmel was a classical social theorist interested in alternative social phenomena to theorists like Marx and Durkheim, such as the artistic personality and fashion (Stones, 2007:91). This resulted in Simmel not being taken as a serious social theorist by many academics despite the relevance of his work. The majority of Simmel’s ideas can be regarded as more applicable to modern society than the period Simmel was writing in as the social matters he wrote about, such as fashion, are a larger part of culture in modern society. Simmel’s ideas surrounding the role of fashion in social interaction are valuable in understanding how fashion is important within culture and social interaction in modern society as he argued fashion is functional for social purposes (Gronow,1993:89). Simmel’s arguments allow us to understand how fashion builds social ties within groups and how it allows an individual to express their individuality. In addition, his work allows us to analyse how fashion can help us understand differences between social classes and genders within a modern society by analysing how social groups use fashion as an expression of status. However, although Simmel’s ideas about the role of fashion are relevant today some of his arguments are restricted in their ability to be applied to modern society due to developments within social structure and divisions between social groups since the time he was writing. Nevertheless, his arguments are still valuable to understand the role of fashion in social interaction in modern society. <nl>Simmel believed that fashion was a \"form of imitation\" (Simmel, 1957:541), he argued that individuals imitate the fashion trends set by others which then results in the trend being spread throughout society. His discussion that fashion itself is a \"form of imitation\" (Simmel, 1957:541) is relevant as a certain style does not become a fashion trend until people start to imitate and adopt the fashion trends set by an individual or a brand which then creates a community of followers who all follow the same trends. Furthermore, his ideas are relevant to modern society as people imitate the fashion trends set by influencers and celebrities within the media as they are whom people aspire to be like. Within modern society brands now employ what is referred to as a brand ambassador which is an individual with a following who will advertise certain fashion trends which members of society then adopt and imitate (Calhoun, 2012:372) in order to feel like they fit into society. For example, girls may aspire to imitate the fashion trends set by the Kardashians as they view them as role models or desire to be like them but when too many people adopt these trends new ones emerge and old ones are abandoned. Therefore, it is evident that Simmel’s idea that fashion is a form of imitation is relevant to modern society. However, Simmel then goes on to discuss how this creates a conflict between the need to express individuality and the need to be accepted (Helle, 2012:49). This argument is relevant as the fashion trends individuals chose to imitate are an expression of their individuality but these trends then categorise them into a social group creating a conflict between the need to stand out and the need to be accepted, Simmel later discusses this in relation to acceptance. Consequently, Simmel’s ideas surrounding the role of imitation are relevant to today’s society as people imitate the fashion trends set by those they aspire to be like or those they view as desirable as they want to be socially accepted. <nl>In addition to this, Simmel also discusses how fashion builds social ties through the acceptance and rejection of individuals to social groups. Simmel argues that if an individual adopts the fashion trends of a group that they are trying to gain access to they are more likely to gain acceptance from the ingroup members as they share something in common by carrying the same fashion trends. Therefore, fashion provides a bridge between an individual and a group (Dollhopf, 2011:5) as it helps the individual to build social ties. This is still valuable in understanding the role of fashion in modern society as people within the same social network carry similar trends to each other and are consequently categorised the same way, for example in modern society those categorised as belonging to an ‘indie’ social group are categorised on factors such as the fashion trends they all adopt. However, this argument is only relevant to modern society in terms of the broader social categories people fall into as within the close knit groups people are more likely to associate with there is more diversity in the fashion trends of the group. This can be linked to Simmel’s discussion of fashion as an expression of individuality because within society there is much more emphasis on fashion in relation to individualism rather than fashion as an expression of status. However, although there is a conflict between the need to express ones individuality and the desire to be socially accepted (Simmel, 1957:543) fashion still allows for the acceptance of an individual to a social group as it displays a sense of similarity between members allowing for them to build social ties. Therefore, Simmel’s ideas in relation to fashion as both a facilitator of gaining acceptance into a social group and as an expression of individuality is still valuable in understanding modern society but it must be discussed that although the fashion trends an individual adopt categorises them into a broader social group it does not limit the individual to that social group as there is more emphasis on diversity within groups in modern society. Nevertheless, Simmel’s ideas are still relevant to understanding the social function of fashion in modern society. <nl>Furthermore, Simmel argues that there is a relationship between fashion and social class divisions. He discusses how fashion provides a distinction between the upper and lower classes as it allows for the expression of status against the lower class as the trends the upper classes adopt aren’t as easily accessible to the lower classes due to their economic position. In addition, he also discusses how fashion unifies the upper class by providing them with a collective dominance over the lower class (Simmel, 1957:541). This argument is valuable in understanding the social function of fashion in modern society as we see the continued division between social classes through the fashion trends they can access as the upper classes have the facilities to purchase the upmarket expensive trends of the wealthy whereas the lower classes are still limited to the fashion trends they can buy into, for example brands such as Gucci are more accessible to the upper classes due to their financial status. Simmel goes on to then discuss how once the fashion trends the upper classes have set are adopted by the lower classes the trends will then be abandoned and new trends will be established (Calhoun, 2012:372). This argument is still relevant today as we observe how trends are spread from those of the upper classes such as celebrities and are then adopted by lower classes as the lower market brands start to develop clothing that fits into the upper class trends making it more accessible to the lower classes and resulting in social class divisions based on these fashion trends being less distinct. However, not all trends in modern society stem from the upper classes as we see lower market high street brands setting trends which are then adopted and are easily accessible to all classes. Despite this, Simmel’s discussion of fashion as an expression of social class status is still relevant to modern society as fashion is still limited to certain individuals based on their economic status meaning the expensive fashion trends and brands can still only be accessed by the upper classes who have the means to gain access which then creates the social class distinctions based on the fashion trends adopted by each class. Therefore, fashion has a social function of showcasing the differences between social classes and consequently their economic position as once trends become more accessible to lower classes they are then abandoned by the upper classes as they want to maintain the distinction and the dominance they have over the lower classes (Lizardo, 2019). Consequently, Simmel’s ideas regarding social class and fashion are still relevant to modern society although it must be considered that not all trends are started by members of the upper classes and that not all members of the lower class desire to access the trends of the upper class. <nl>Moreover, Simmel examines the relationship between fashion and gender. He argues that fashion is primarily associated with women as it allows them to express their individuality in the oppressed position they are in (Helle, 2012:49). This argument is relevant to understanding modern society as fashion is still greatly associated with women however this argument is limited as fashion has expanded to be more related to men as well as fashion has become important as an expression of individuality for all members of society. Particularly, fashion has gained importance in the lives of young men who take more notice of the relevant fashion trends they wish to adopt. Therefore, although it is still relevant to suggest that fashion is more associated with women as we see in the media that fashion is more targeted at women than men it cannot be denied that fashion has become much more associated with men as well as we have progressed into modern society. Furthermore, the discussion that fashion is one of the ways women express themselves as an oppressed group is limited in its relevance as although women are still viewed as an oppressed group their position in society has greatly improved since the time Simmel was writing in with modern society making a great amount of progress in regards to equality for example with more women in employment. Simmel develops this argument by suggesting fashion accommodates for lack of status women can obtain from employment (Simmel, 1957:551). This argument is outdated as the percentage of women in employment has increased since the time Simmel was writing and as has essentially equalised with the number of men in employment therefore arguing fashion accommodates for the expression of status women cannot access from employment is not relevant to modern society. However, Simmel’s idea that fashion provides a means of expression for women is relevant to understanding the social function of fashion in modern society however it is equally as important as a means for men to express themselves as women but it can be acknowledge that Simmel’s idea that fashion is more associated with women is relevant in modern society as although it has become more relevant in the lives of men it is still primarily associated with women. <nl>In conclusion, Simmel’s ideas about the social function of fashion are still valuable in understanding modern society. His arguments surrounding imitation and acceptance are still relevant as we observe people imitating trends set by those they view as desirable to copy and we see people adopting certain fashion trends to gain access to certain groups. In addition, Simmel’s discussion of fashion as an expression of individuality is valuable and relevant in understanding the role of fashion in modern society however his argument that this has a higher importance in the lives of women due to their oppressed position is limited as women have made improvements in their position and fashion has become equally as important in the lives of men. Nevertheless, his discussion of fashion as a means of expressing status between the upper and lower classes is still relevant to society today as we see upper classes starting trends and abandoning them once they are adopted by the lower classes. Consequently, Simmel’s work regarding the social function of fashion is relevant to society today as his ideas are applicable to several areas of society however it must be taken into account that some of his ideas are limited due to the developments made in society from the time Simmel was writing in.

These axioms include preferences, transitivity, indifferent, preference and no alternative being infinitely better than other.<nl>1.<tab>Preferences being well ordered means that two possible outcomes, (A and B) either A would be preferring to B or B to A, otherwise, the decision maker is known to be indifferent meaning they do not care which one becomes known.<nl>2.<tab>Preferences being transitive refers to A being preferred to B, as well as B being preferred over C therefore, A would be preferred to C as well.

Furthermore, indifferent has been proved wrong by ‘framing’ by the Asian-flu problem (Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1981). People tend to point out the negative losses more.

It can be concluded that the results supported the theory that cue left would be higher than cue right amplitudes when recording from P3. <nl>Experiment write up, 1200 +- 10% (min1080, max1320) words, titles, title page tables, figures &amp; reference list not included in count<nl>Introduction<nl>The AIH, states that more alpha activity in one hemisphere leads to loss of attention and the disengagement of task irrelevant brain areas (the other hemisphere), this indicates inhibition. Whereas less activity in one hemisphere leads to the opposite; an increase in attention and engagement (Klimesch et al., 2007). Alpha activity or waves are a type of brain wave. They are produced in circumstances of rest, especially when your eyes are closed and happen before you fall asleep (Alpha Waves and How They Help You Sleep, n.d.). <nl>The AIH is supported with research such as (Handel et al., 2011) who used a MEG (magneto-encephalogram) which has better spatial resolution and similar temporal resolution to an EEG for better results. They found that alpha activity is reduced in contralateral brain areas to the stimuli presented, that alpha activity is influenced by attention. <nl>A partial replication of Sauseng et al.’s (2005) experiment: \"A shift of visual spatial attention is selectively associated with human EEG alpha activity\", was conducted to compare alpha amplitudes at P3 between conditions and prove the hypothesis that cue left would be higher than cue right amplitudes when recording from P3. As stimuli always processes contralaterally (opposite side of activity) We wanted to find out whether if, a side of the visual field was cued, would it lead to alpha inhibition on the contralateral side where participants anticipated the stimuli would appear? And which side would show bigger alpha amplitudes?<nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants<nl>38 undergraduate students took part in the research via volunteer sampling, there were originally 39, but one participant’s data were removed as their data were only available for one of the two conditions. <nl>Design<nl>The design of the study was a repeated measure, the independent variable was whether the arrow cues pointed left or right, it also had two levels known as cue left and cue right. The dependent variable was the alpha amplitudes measured in µV (microvolts), recorded from P3.<nl>Materials<nl>A Biopac MP36 was used to collect data and EEG Electrodes were attached to participants’ scalps using AC cream, Everi cream. PsychoPy software was used to present stimuli for a specific period of time and send event markers set to end immediately to Biopac, through a Stimtracker device. The Stimuli used were two white bars on a black background, one large, one small (see figure 1). Two arrows, one pointing left and one pointing right (see figure 2). And white fixation cross (see figure 3). <nl><figure><nl><nl>Procedure<nl>Firstly, the Biopac channel was set up to record raw EEG 0.5-35Hz, digital channels were set up to receive event markers from PsychoPy and Stimtracker, event markers let us know when stimuli were shown. Calculation channels were set up to record activity in the alpha frequency range from 8-13Hz before checking the impedance, with the sampling rate being 1000 Hz, alpha amplitudes were also measured.  Participants had EEG electrodes with AC cream on them placed on their scalps using the 1020 positioning system (Trans-Cranial Techologies.,2012), with P3 being recorded. The active electrode was placed at P3, the reference electrode was attached to Fz, an earth electrode was attached to the forehead near the hairline and everything was measured relative to Cz.The areas were scrubbed with Everi cream beforehand for better adhesion. They were then asked to complete a cued visual attention task using PsychoPy. <nl>Cued with a fixation cross at the centre of the screen for 34ms an arrow indicating whether it would be the left or right side of the visual field the target, would appear, in the centre of the screen for 34ms whilst participants were asked by the experimenter to focus their attention to that side of the visual field. There was 50% chance of being cued left or right. There were different event markers for cue left and right conditions and they were sent at stimulus onset. There were 20 blocks of 4 trial types, each block had cued right small bar, cued left small bar, cued right large bar, and cued left large bar) randomised within blocks with half of trials cued left and half cued right. <nl><nl>Results<nl>The raw 9-13Hz Alpha EEG data for each condition was analysed using the event markers sent from PsychoPy to identify when the stimuli would be presented. We looked at the period of 200ms of recorded activity before stimulus presentation, after arrow cues had been shown and used Biopac by rectifying and averaging over 50 samples of raw alpha data to show alpha activity regardless of whether it was excitatory or inhibitory. This smooths out the data (averaging over samples), reduces the impact of outlyingextreme values and converts negative values to positive, so we get an average deviation from 0 in microvolts. <nl>Statistical Analysis<nl>Table 1 shows that the rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA) were higher in the cue left condition than the cue right condition. According to the Wilcoxon signed rank test, the difference was significant, and the inferential statistics are as follows (t=566, n=38, p&lt;0.005). <nl><nl>Discussion<nl>The results were significant, so we used a non-parametric test to find the inferential statistics from the data collected. The results fit with the hypothesis as the results are consistent with AIH as recorded activity from P3cue left were higher than cue right, which were the task irrelevant brain areas, suggesting that alpha suppression happened there.<nl>Methodological issues that could have affected the results could have been varying levels of impedance, associated with more variance in the measurements but would affect both conditions equally. Another methodological issue that could have affected results could have been artefacts, such as blinking, that would affect the waves. From the experiment overall, I conclude that the AIH is highly supported by research as it has high temporal reliability, and despite all the methodological issues, the results are still valid.\"", "there,<nl><nl> <nl><nl>Please find attached my placement documents below for review and feedback,<nl><nl> <nl><nl>Kind regards,<nl><nl> <nl><nl><part_FN_SN><new>Hi <addr19_FN>,<nl><nl> <nl><nl>I submitted evidence of an event I’ll be attending, I didn’t see any obvious evidence that my PDF was uploaded, is it okay if you could just double check I’ve attached a file to my submission and let me know please?<nl><nl> <nl><nl>Kind regards,<nl><nl> <nl><nl><part_FN_SN><new>Hi <addr2_FN>,<nl><nl> <nl><nl>Sorry for the late submission, but please find attached all the information required for our event; including two of the event request forms and event posters.<nl><nl> <nl><nl>Kind regards,<nl><nl> <nl><nl><part_FN_SN><new>Hi <addr13_FN>,<nl><nl> <nl><nl>The details are correct,<nl><nl> <nl><nl>Kind regards,<nl><nl> <nl><nl><part_FN_SN><new>Hi <addr18_FN>,<nl><nl> <nl><nl>My apologies, I sent this email to you by mistake<nl><nl> <nl><nl>Kind regards,<nl><nl> <nl><nl><part_FN_SN><new>Hi <addr16_FN>,<nl><nl> <nl><nl>Please find attached my improved placement documents.<nl><nl> <nl><nl>Kind regards,<nl><nl> <nl><nl><part_FN><new>Hi <addr2_FN>,<nl><nl> <nl><nl>Thank you for forwarding these and keeping us in the loop!

{"id": "d9a2db3c-f760-4928-8c34-3f4d8855e5c7", "discourse_types": ["essay", "text_message"], "pair": ["\"Hands up. Don’t Shoot!\" \"End SARS!\" \"Go Green!!\" are just a few of the chant slogans many protesters all over the world use. The ample number of protests traversing disparate time zones has caught the attention of academics, critics and communities worldwide. In today’s society, we are witnessing and experiencing is an upsurge of protest. Whether that is in America, Asia, Europe or Sub-Saharan Africa, each continent is living in an ‘Age of Mass Protest’. It is right to suggest that there have been recurring themes of inequality, repression and unrest partnered with many failed governments and politics that contribute to this increase. The frequency, scope and size of these protests are considered ‘mass protests’ that have essentially captured media attention, such as those in Britain, Nigeria and North America. Although each protest has a unique context and cause, the common grievances overwhelmingly draw on the opinions and viewpoints of feeble and ineffectual governance, nepotism and malfeasance. Thus, the essay will delve into the claim that indeed, we are living in an ‘Age of Mass Protest’ by analysing the root causes of the increase in global protests. These include inequality, corruption and environmental degradation. Social media will also be used to show how fast news spread which potentially could be the reason for a rise in mass protests. In addition, the essay will assess whether grievance theories may play a role in explaining a rise in mass protests by exploring the views of erudite scholars and academics of International Relations, who examine the impact of grievances on protest behaviours. <nl>Firstly, for us to understand and analyse the claim, the term ‘mass protest’ needs to be defined. According to Karl-Dieter Opp (2009), protest defines as a \"joint (i.e. collective) action of individuals aimed at achieving their goal or goals by influencing decisions of a target.\" The motive behind the collective action is \"to draw attention to the grievances; the action is further meant to provoke ameliorative steps by some target group\" (Turner, 1969). Although both definitions are coherent, they fail to deeply define large-scale protests. Ergo, the word ‘mass’ has been added to disclose that the action is carried out by an extensive caucus of citizens. With its causes ranging from basic human rights to economic  social injustice to impoverished government and corruption, the term ‘protest’ is an ‘umbrella’ term for many various forms of expression. <nl>Whether a protest takes the form of a petition (passive protest) or a boycott (direct protest), the sea of protests the world has witnessed leads us to question why mass protests are increasing in frequency. We must understand the catalyst behind mass protests in order to mitigate their effects on the rest of the world. The most evident and plausible explanation for the increase in mass protests would be economic and social inequality. The World Bank (2012) believes that \"Inequality and inequity remain the global genesis of poverty and relative deprivation,\" which further addresses that \"they are the reasons why social movements commence to rebel against unresolved generational disparities and societal injustices\" (Pridemore, 2008). Pridemore’s perspective can be exemplified in the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement. Many within the movement have protested because of the scarcity or denied quality of life aspects (i.e., education, employment, healthcare, housing etc.). In addition, they have been vocal at raising awareness for the social injustice and systemic racism they face when seeing the devaluation of African American lives. <nl>The creation of the movement was influenced after George Zimmerman’s acquittal in the shooting death of African American teen, Trayvon Martin in February 2012. Since its founding, the movement has flourished and gained attention from many around the world who have started social justice protests of their own. This is due to social media’s input which has \"engaged global audiences at unprecedented speed\" (Foer, 2017). The highly publicised murders by police enforcement of Eric Garner (2014), Philando Castile (2016), Sandra Bland (2015) etc. and more recently, George Floyd (2020) stand testament to this. Since the death of Floyd in May 2020, ACLED have recorded over 7,750 demonstrations and protests linked to the BLM movement, across all 50 states in America, as well as other countries, such as the UK. From this statistic, it is right to suggest that we are living in an ‘Age of Mass Protest’ as in this case, the lives of African Americans are being deprived of social justice and racial equality. Hence why deprived individuals within this movement will be more likely to lead to certain protest behaviours. Many theorists such as Klandermans (1997) and Useem (1998) have conflicting definitions of deprivation, but Gurney and Tierney’s (1982) definition is apt in this discussion of social movements. They define it as \"the combination of emotional frustrations and social inequality perceptions that prevent an individual, group or community to thrive within the mainstream societal context\". Their definition puts particular focus on the difference between experienced reality and what is to be expected. In the same way, BLM protesters want economic and social equality but have received the opposite. <nl>Many researchers and theorists have invoked the grievance theory, Relative Deprivation (RD) to explain the phenomena of participating in mass protests and how they interact with deprivation to enhance the protest potential of grievances. For example, Eversley et al. (2017) applies the theoretical framework of the RD theory to explain why inequality and RD incites the BLM movement to protest. In her article, she provides commentary on the four stages of social movements-emergence, coalescence, bureaucratization and decline to highlight BLM’s social movement life cycle. Paying close attention to Eversley’s perception of coalescence (second) stage, in particular, she asserts that BLM use communal and collective action to broadly promote the social injustices endured and establish other coalitions to further protest the movement’s concerns and demands. Her assertion supports the claim as she uses the concept of coalescence to highlight how BLM’s tactics are strategically used which has broadened the movement ‘far beyond its core support’. More importantly what is evident in her argument is that RD plays a role in explaining collective action and thus spurs mass protest. The application to relative deprivation theory further highlights that \"for many Blacks, poverty and relative deprivation are the impetuses why Blacks mobilize to collectively protest against the societal injustices targeted against them\" (Adler, 2015). <nl>Correspondingly, Nigeria’s deprivation of social justice, which is caused by their corrupt governance of state, is another important factor to assess when analysing whether we are living in an ‘Age of Mass Protest’. Runciman’s development of RD (1966) can be employed to explain Nigeria’s cause of mass protests. Runciman uses the concept of social justice centered around RD, to argue that there is a sense of dissatisfaction people feel when they observe other people having something they desire, which is within their grasp but insurmountable. His theory focuses on four criteria for RD. Nonetheless, his first condition promotes that Person A does not have X – hence why Person A may feel deprived and feel the need to protest. This viewpoint is highly fitting and relatable to the #EndSars movement, as Nigerians feel a disconnect to social justice. Nigeria’s lack of capacity in terms of the attainment of effective governance that addresses the issues of corruption and human rights for example is generally traced to leadership failure (Achebe, 1988). In light of this, the feeble governance that is portrayed in many developing countries is at large and thrives in sub-Saharan Africa. According to the Economist report, data displays that mass protests have increased annually by an average of 11.5 percent from 2009 to 2019 across all regions of the world, with the fastest growth in sub-Saharan Africa (23.8% global average per year increase). This data is significant as it suggests that the number and intensity of African mass protests have inflated, which reflects \"pre-existing frustrations with social and political conditions that have now been further exacerbated by the COVID-19 restrictions\" (Ramdeen, 2020). For Nigeria, as of recently, their frustrations lie within the government’s incompetence and lack of accountability. As of October 2020, the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) caused an outbreak of mass protests. Established in 1992, the purpose of the squad was to combat against armed robbers becoming rampant. However, SARS became controversial after abusing their power by unlawfully killing, harassing, kidnapping, and extorting money from young individuals, leaving them deprived of good governance. <nl>In application to Runciman’s first condition, he exemplifies that deprived individuals, in times of crisis, are likely to demonstrate specific protest behaviours. Despite Runciman’s insight, it could be argued that his theory fails to analyse why some people who are also affected by the cause, fail to act and join social movements in active engagement. From a different viewpoint, deprivation can reduce protest engagement. This is supported by Thomas Kurer (2019), who believes that the decline of citizens’ economic grievances can affect their inclination to protest, however those who experience more deterioration than others may want to mobilise more politically. To some extent, relative deprivation can spur mass engagement in protest activism, however this depends on how much an individual has endured. This can be supported by the idea that there are more youth igniting these mass protests. It is therefore right to suggest that mass protests are thriving in a country where humanity is still relatively youthful and social media is used as an outlet to express their grievances. Social media’s contribution has encouraged countries, such as the UK, to create their own mass protests, shedding their grievances on the issue as well. Their impact accentuates that \"Social media is a way of the voiceless and those that cannot help physically express themselves\" (Wilding et. al, 2018). The inference to be drawn from this is the Nigerian government’s abuse of power coupled with how social media has been used to transmit news across the world, resulting in an uproar of protests. <nl>By the same token, the need for reform in climate change is a motivation behind a rise in mass protests. The Extinction Rebellion (XR) movement in the UK attempt to pursue their goal of compelling action to tackle environmental issues and sought to address the problems of unresponsive government. Arguably, they are deprived of receptive government and thus use direct action tactics (such as collectively blockading bridges and chaining themselves to buildings) to disseminate their views. This is supported by XR’s co- founder, Roger Hallam who argues that \"mass civil disobedience is our only option.\" In a globalized society, the global problem of climate change will not be solved by individual states or even international organizations (Doolen, 2020), hence the need for collective action. Thus, using the theoretical scaffold of Collective Action (CA) Theory (Olson, 1965) can provide reasons as to why there are mass XR protests. Evidently, CA is a powerful motivational push to protest as it encourages participation. This is reinforced by Hayes* (2020) who says that \"Extinction Rebellion seems to have succeeded in mobilising new people.\" ‘Collective identification intensifies feelings of efficacy’ (Simon et. al, 1998). Simon’s notion adds value to the argument as it justifies how effective XR’s active participation has become at garnering media attention. Additionally, the proliferation of social media, despite its offline participation, corresponds with the Habermasian criteria of high accessibility and relatively unrestricted ability to confer (Habermas, 1989). It has generated a ‘global diffusion’ (Della Porta, 2017). This is exemplified in the copious number of environmental protests occurring worldwide - Spain, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and Sweden- where the nation’s sensation, Greta Thunberg campaigns for ecological change. To summarise, the XR protests have resulted in an uproar of protests due to their collective action and deprivation of responsive governments. The grievances felt from XR protesters portray how the principles and values they place highly are being violated. <nl>Recently, mass protests have become numerous and geographically widespread. Protests have become an escalated global trend and continue to play a role in shaping the political landscape and determining the next cultural, economic, and social decisions. With many notable frustrations around the world currently, effective social media platforms have proven to increase the spread of mass protests. This essay has attempted to critically assess the common causes and themes that arise which garners a reaction and then essentially a protest. The grievance theory discussed has provided valid reason as to why BLM, #EndSars and XR are protesting in masses.

{"id": "cf86bb8e-ebb4-46b5-aa56-a103af99cb6a", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["In the United Kingdom in 2019 there was 1.6% of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) (Postnote, 2020). The high number of ASD children means that it is imperative to have correct measures in place when they are put through police interviewing. There are policies in place to support children under the age of 18 who classed as ‘vulnerable witnesses’ (impairment to intelligence and social functioning), by giving them assistance to provide the best evidence possible in court (Ministry of Justice, 2011). However, in our justice system there are still issues which need to be corrected, as current research shows that when a child is labelled with ‘autism’ the evidence they provide is questioned in credibility by jurors (Crane et al., 2018). <nl><nl>On top of this, the difficulties present in ASD children could significantly impact the information that is gathered by police, as they lack communication, social skills (Knott et al., 2006) and also impairments in memory (Bruck et al., 2007). There are two recommendations which will be examined to help police gather evidence in ASD children.<nl><nl>The standard cognitive interview includes four main techniques (Köhnken et al., 1999). Mental context reinstatement (MRC) is one segment of the interview that requires the person to go back in time to remember the emotions they felt and the physical environment around them (Maras &amp; Bowler, 2011). However, ASD children have impairments in their memory, specifically in their autonoetic consciousness (Gardiner, 2001), this therefore, means that they might find the process of MRC difficult. Evidence has shown this to be true as people with autism recalled fewer details in the MRC interview (Maras &amp; Bowler, 2010). This is especially relevant to ASD children, as they already tend to recall fewer details than typically developing (TD) children (Williams et al., 2006). Therefore, police need to find an appropriate way of aiding recall for ASD children as the MRC has shown to exacerbate their memory.<nl><nl>The inclusion of sketching as a form of context reinstatement (Sketch-RC) rather than the normal MRC before a free recall has been seen to be beneficial for ASD children in recall (Mattison et al., 2014). A study that delved further into this had used ASD children and TD children to watch a video (Mattison et al., 2018), and then had compared sketch-RC and MRC, following with a free recall afterward. A probed recall phase was also used to gain further detail, but it was entirely based on what the children had stated in their free recall. In this case, the findings supported the usage of sketch-RC in interviewing as ASD children recalled 25% more than the ASD children in the MRC condition. This could be explained by the encoding specificity theory (Tulving, 1972); which states that the ASD children recalled better because the cues were present in encoding and retrieving, so, the sketches helped facilitate these cues more than just mentally reinstating the context. <nl><nl>In contrast, Henry et al (2017) had conducted a similar study but additionally looked into ‘verbal labels’ and ‘registered intermediary’ interviews, there was no improvement in recall to the ASD children in the Sketch-RC or the other two interviews. This comes to question whether Sketch-RC does improve memory recall or were there methodological issues that caused the study to not find any significant results. This study did have its limitations, as Dando et al (2018) had brought this to light. Participants were aimlessly placed in either a live condition or a video condition, 83% of TD children and only 30% of ASD children were placed in the live condition. This could have impacted the significance of the results because ASD children are more perceptive of their surroundings, as they process sensory information around them differently (O’Neill and Jones, 1997), therefore the children could have encoded the information differently when streaming a video version rather than witnessing the live event, impacting the validity of the results. <nl>Even though there might be drawbacks to the article’s methodology to cause the results to not support sketch-RC, there are still several studies that reinforce the idea of how positive the sketch-RC can be in real life. For instance, a field study had looked into children’s accounts of sexual abuse. The use of drawing had significantly increased the amount of detail recalled, rather than just a standard interview (Katz &amp; Hershkowitz, 2009). With this in mind, sketch-RC has shown to be valuable in the real world as well as in just studies, so police should highly consider using this method to capture more information. <nl> <nl>The takeaway message is that the MRC in a cognitive interview might not be an appropriate measure to gather information from ASD children. So, the use of sketch-RC might be considered more appropriate than MRC when conducting a cognitive interview for ASD children, as it allows them to access memories using the contextual cues from their sketches. This will be fairly important in real life as each information given by the witness can help in finding the perpetrator or piecing the investigation together. <nl>Consequently, social interaction is vital in police interviewing, as it requires a verbal exchange of information. However, ASD children tend to lack the social skills to interact and confidently communicate to get their ideas across (Knott et al., 2006). The cognitive interview, therefore, might pose a problem, as ASD children will consider it socially demanding (Johnson, et al., 2018), which might cause them to become distressed and impact their retrieval of information (Quas &amp; Lench, 2007).<nl><nl>On account of this, the advancements in technology can allow police interviews to be conducted with robots rather than humans to minimise the distress (Wood et al., 2013). There have been significant benefits in the use of robots, as they have shown to improve the social skills of TD children (Robins et al., 2004; Aresti-Bartolome and Garcia-Zapirain 2014) and in ASD children (Wainer et al., 2010).<nl>The creation of ‘Kinesics and Synchronization in Personal Assistant Robotics’ (KASPAR) has shown to be beneficial to ASD children. An observational study had been conducted to see how children would react to the KASPAR with adults present (Robins et al., 2009). They had found that the ASD children interacted positively by smiling, touching, and gazing at the KASPAR. Also, an important finding they had found was that it helped facilitate social interactions with the co-present adult. This could be beneficial in police interviewing as it will help support the ASD child in feeling comfortable, but also can act as a social mediator for when ASD children are being interviewed. <nl><nl>Nevertheless, evidence has shown that the KASPAR does come with its challenges, as a study had found that children were scared of viewing the robot because of how it looked (Huijnen et al., 2018). This would undermine the use of KASPAR, as it would cause further distress and impacting the ASD child’s memory.<nl><nl>Opposed to this view, a reinforcing study by Wood et al (2013) had comparable results to Robins et al (2009) using the KASPAR. However, the study involved the children to be interviewed in a similar manner to a police interview, as they had used questions that would retrieve facts and not feelings from the children. The eye gaze and interview duration were much longer when the interviewer was a KASPAR rather than a human. This key finding links with ASD children as eye contact is a necessary part of communication (Nation and Penny., 2008). This adds support to the use of KASPAR in police interviews as it will help ASD children to feel at ease and help in memory recall; but also this study helps put in perspective how the use of a robot could help ASD children in a police setting. <nl>ASD children’s perception of the KASPAR allows us to understand why they feel more closer to robots than humans. They seem to identify them as toys (Peca et al., 2014) and neither a living nor non-living being (Kahn et al., 2012); suggesting that robots are seen as less intimidating than humans, which allows them to react to them in an anthropomorphic way. <nl><nl>However, with the recent addition of rapport-building in the cognitive interview, it can be argued that there might not be a need for the KASPAR. As the rapport-building phase has demonstrated to make children feel comfortable and confide to the interviewer considerably more (Hershkowitz, 2011). In opposition to this, the use of robots has seemed to show the same effects as the rapport-building phase, as a study had shown that children were more likely to share the secret to the robot than to the teacher after being prompted equally in both conditions (Bethel et al., 2011). Therefore, the use of a robot could be more beneficial and less time consuming when gaining information from a child.<nl><nl>In summary, the evidence above provides the KASPAR to accomplish what a human interviewer might not be able to in a cognitive interview. It suggests that the KASPAR can aid children in feeling relaxed, as this is important in salvaging memories of the witnessed event. But most importantly it can help the police interviewers by acting as a social mediator between the child and the interviewer. Police should therefore highly consider the use of a KASPAR for ASD children.<nl><nl>To conclude, both uses of a sketch-RC and a humanoid robot appear to support ASD children in memory. Sketch-RC is an improvement from the standard MRC as it visually helps ASD children to see the contextual cues. The KASPAR also helps benefit in the interaction of the ASD child and the interviewer, which in turn allows the child to feel at ease and not impede their memory. Both recommendations have a significant amount of evidence to support their use, yet there have been a few limitations which interferes in their validity of being useful. It should however still be considered in the use of police interviews.", "nk you for sending that over. It helps to have some idea when things will be!

{"id": "d0ee9ff1-93ef-4cd5-9be2-f65587aaf196", "discourse_types": ["essay", "text_message"], "pair": ["\"Autism Spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder (Hodges et al, 2020). A diagnosis of ASD according to the DSM-IV-TR entails a minimum of two social impairments, one communication and one in restricted and repetitive behaviours (RRB) (American Psychiatric association, 1994). The ‘Big 3’ psychological theories are Theory of Mind (ToM); Weak Central Coherence (WCC) and executive dysfunction (ED).<nl>ToM is the ability to attribute mental states to oneself and others (Tager-Flusberg, 2006). 80% of children with ASD, failed the Sally Anne false belief task (which investigates ToM) (Baren-Cohen, Leslie &amp; Frith, 1985) compared to typically developing (TD) children. However, 20% of children still passed. This doesn’t account for performances by higher-functioning individuals with autism (HFAI), as Happe (1995) states passing false-belief tasks are predicted by verbal mental age. Furthermore, Happe’s 1994 strange stories test found individuals with autism (IWA) showed difficulties with irony, sarcasm, and metaphors. This can account for social and communicative impairments such as sustaininginitiating 2-way conversations, subsequently causing  failure to develop peer relationships. However, this may be due to under-connectivity in left-hemispheres (Verley et al, 2014). In addition, IWA also showed difficulty in reading eyes tasks (Baren-Cohen et al, 2001), which suggests impairments of joint attention (JA). Furthermore, children with autism, have impairments in following eyes andor giving appropriate eye contact (Neumann, 2006), as well as issues using declarative gestures. Baron-Cohen (1994) stated this was due to a deficit in shared attention, according to mind-reading system. This can explain social and communication impairments e.g., lack of shared enjoyment and failure to use non-verbal behaviours. However, ToM fails to account for RRB such as a tendency for routinesrules and circumscribed interests. <nl>ED involves deficits in planning, inhibition, and cognitive flexibility (Rajendran &amp; Mitchell, 2007). IWA show poor cognitive flexibility in the Wisconsin card sorting task (WCST) (Nelson, 1976). This can be due to perseverative behaviour. However, Minshew et al (1992) found perseverative ability is linked to verbal IQ as they found no differences between TD and HFAI. Thus, ED cannot solely and universally explain deficits. Furthermore, IWA have planning deficits illustrated in Tower of Hanoi task (Ozonoff &amp; Jensen, 1999). However, Hughes (1996) found IWA were able to do puzzles requiring  fewer steps. Although planning isn’t completely impaired, disruption of routinesrules causes distress to IWA (Rajendran &amp; Mitchell, 2007).<nl>Studies aforementioned do not account for individual differences, as performances may be different in HFAI due to  Verbal IQ. Furthermore, ED also occurs in individuals with schizophrenia and Tourette’s who perform similarly to IWA on executive function tests (Rajendran &amp; Mitchell, 2007).  This limits the potential of ED as a diagnostic marker for ASD. <nl>The Weak Central Coherence theory (WCC) (Frith, 1989) states IWA possess a bias towards local elements. Evidence for this is in embedded figures (Witkin, 1971) and block design tasks (Shah &amp; Frith, 1983), in which children with ASD displayed superior performance. Furthermore, Happe (1996) found IWA weren’t susceptible to visual illusions. These local biases can account for IWA showing pre-occupations for parts of objects. In further support, Hobson &amp; Lee (1998) found IWA do not process faces as a whole as they weren’t susceptible to inversion effect, due to this local bias processing. Furthermore, IWA show activity in primary visual cortex, linked to perception (Chung &amp; Son, 2020) which can explain performances, therefore, WCC isn’t a sole explanation for superior performances. Frith &amp; Snowling (1983) found IWA failed to use appropriate associations on homograph tasks, as they focused on sole words instead of the whole context, further supporting WCC. This can explain social communicative impairments such as sustaining conversation or developing relationships. Although, Lopez &amp; Leekam (2003) found IWA were able to use appropriate word associations in their visual homograph task suggesting such deficits are sensitive to task modalities.  <nl>In conclusion, the ‘Big 3’ psychological theories contribute to the ASD clinical profile to an extent.  ToM can account for social and communicative impairments, but not universally, as well as inability to explain RRB. Although, EDT can account for RRB i.e., adherence to routinesrules, is not exclusive to ASD. The WCC accounts for social and non-social behaviours but brain regions also play a role. This shows ASD is a multiple deficit disorder without a one theory fits all. The fractionation theory suggests the 3 domains are distinct at a cognitive level (Happe &amp; Ronald, 2008), but Russell et al (1991) states there is overlap between all domains highlighted in performances and theories, thus further research is need on domain specificity.<nl><nl><question2><nl>Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit atypical behaviours compared to typically developing individuals (TD). Lower-level processes such as  enhanced perceptual functioning (EPF); social motivational theory (SMT) and spontaneous mimicry (SM) may account for such differences.<nl>Evidence for EPF arises from embedded figures task (Witkin et al, 1971), as well as block design tasks (Shah &amp; Frith, 1983) in which children with ASD show superior performance to TD. In block design tasks, children with autism also show no further advantage to pre-segmented designs. This is due to perceptual processes being enhanced in ASD, which leads to locally orientateddetailed focused perception, compared to weak central coherence (WCC) which outlines a bias towards local elements (Charman et al, 2013). Thus, EPF highlights superiority in perceptual processing compared to processing style in WCC. Furthermore, IWA perform faster than TD children on conjunctive visual search tasks (Plaisted, O’Riordan &amp; Baron-Cohen, 1998) which further supports IWA have enhanced perceptual discrimination (Plaisted, O’Riordan &amp; Baron-Cohen, 1998) as EPF enables IWA to discriminate against colours and features resulting  in this faster processing. <nl>EPF can also explain savant skills, which are more common in ASD than the general population (Mottron et al, 2006), which highlights strengths of ASD. For example, exceptional drawing skills are due to EPF, as this encourages IWA to avoid perceptual closure, leading to more accurate and detailed focused drawings (Chamberlain et al, 2013). However, EPF doesn’t explain why this only occurs in some IWA, as there may be individual variations in processing perceptual information. <nl>EPF can also explain atypicality in sensory symptoms in IWA. Due to this enhanced perceptual processing, the threshold of detecting sensations is lowered (Lawson et al, 2015). However, Triomphe et al (2019) found IWA have atypical Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) modulation (linked to inhibition) which also explains tactile hypersensitivity in ASD. Therefore, EPF isn’t a sole explanation of why hypersensitivity occurs in IWA. Another limitation is EPF fails to explain why hyposensitivity occurs, and thus has weak explanatory power regarding sensory processing. <nl>Another low-level process in ASD is SM.  In electromyography responses in IWA, SM of emotional expressions is shown to be atypical (Beall et al, 2008) andor delayed (Oberman, Winkielman &amp; Ramachandran, 2009). SM is important for socio-emotional reciprocity, as Chartrand and Bargh (1999) found being mimicked makes people like us more. SM also underlies empathy (Drimalla et al, 2019). Therefore, this can explain impairments in developing relationships in ASD as well as a  lack of shared enjoyment displayed in ASD as IWA prefer to play on their own (Chevallier et al, 2012). <nl>The SMT explains deficits in social cognition related to lower-level processes.  Eye-tracking experiments by Klin et al (2002) found children with ASD look more at the background than characters in static social photographs. Furthermore, Vlamings et al (2010) found IWA have impairments in processing and identifying faces. According to EPF, this is due to enhanced processing of high spatial frequency information, an atypical process focusing on fine perceptual detail. However, the SMT states IWA  have less motivation to attend to faces as it is less rewarding, and this lack of experience can lead to poorer processing (Chevallier et al, 2012).<nl>Furthermore, Chamberlain, Rothman-Fuller and Kasari (2007) found children with ASD prefer isolated tasks compared to collaborative. Chevallier et al (2012) found this is due to selective social anhedonia (inability to feel social pleasure) in adolescents with ASD and this correlates with ASD severity. This explains impaired initiating and responding to in children with ASD in joint attention.   <nl>In conclusion, the above theories can contribute to atypical differences in ASD. EPF can explain atypical differences at a social and non-social level in ASD. SMT involves deficits in orienting to social information and behaviours which maintain social interaction (Chevallier et al, 2012), explaining social and communication impairments. Although, this cannot account for atypical restricted and repetitive behaviours (RRB) shown in IWA. In addition, despite SM being able to explain atypical social behaviours, it fails to explain communication and RRB. Failing to  account for a whole domain shown in IWA entirely shows serious limitations in using these theories for an explanatory power of the full ASD clinical profile. Furthermore, evidence given in support of these studies are task-dependent and artificial, such as eye-tracking and facial processing experiments as they do not reflect real-life settings. Likewise, lab studies lack validity and therefore may not be extrapolated. The above theories aren’t universal across all IWA as individual variations occur due to it being a spectrum disorder, as well as co-morbidity.

The above theories aren’t universal across all IWA as individual variations occur due to it being a spectrum disorder, as well as co-morbidity. Further research needs to be conducted on individual variations on atypical differences.<nl><nl><question4><nl>Apraxia of speech (AoS) is an acquired motor speech disorder (Ballard, Granier &amp; Robin, 2000). Phonological representation is intact and there is no difficulty in motor realization, but there is an impairment in converting representations into a motor plan; this results in but isn’t limited to; phonological and phonetic speech errors, distorted prosody and groping (visibleauditory attempts to find right position for articulators) (Galluzzi et al, 2015). There are many accounts regarding the cognitive difficulties underlying apraxia which I will compare and contrast.<nl>Firstly, there is an impairment in knowledge, specifically, a loss of knowledge of word-sized articulatory programmes. The hypothesis states there is damage to a direct word route which impairs retrieval for articulatory planning. Instead, speakers have to use a less efficient, laborious route. Varley and Whiteside (2001) state some apraxic speakers (AS) have lost the ability to access stored plans and thus assemble speech from smaller units, which causes dysfluency shown in AoS. Furthermore, Varley, Whiteside &amp; Luff (1999) found there were no frequency effects in word durations with 4 AS. However, results weren’t significant. Contrastingly, Aichert and Ziegler (2004) propose brain damage in apraxia causes a loss of lower frequency routes and perseverations of higher frequency ones. This is consistent with a similar notion AS have an impairment in knowledge of the spatio-temporal parameters associated with speech, such as word retrieval in speech production,  which has also led to imprecise motor planning (Shriberg, Aram &amp; Kwiatkowski, 1997). Ziegler &amp; Cramon (1986) support this as they found AS have difficulties in knowing which parameters to use or knowing timings of lowering the velum, which can cause phonetic errors.  <nl>The reduced buffer capacity hypothesis (RBCH) is another account of cognitive difficulties underlying apraxia (Rogers and Storkel, 1999). Firstly, a limitation in the articulatory output buffer which is involved in phoneme-articulatory conversion. The speech motor buffer can only fit one syllable at a time; this can account for syllabic segregation, false stops, and  pauses between syllablesconsonants in AS. This means AS can’t activate several speech motor programmes simultaneously (Galluzzi et al, 2015). Secondly, there is reduced efficiency of the articulatory planner as the process of phonological to auditory conversion has become slower andor less precise (Buchwald &amp; Miozzo 2012), similar to the hypothesis above. This accounts for slower speech shown in AS with impreciseness explaining phonetic errors produced. In addition, RBCH states speakers may simplify consonants as they are more difficult to produce e.g., CCV template to CV template  (Bernhardt &amp; Stemberger, 1998). Deger &amp; Ziegler (2002) support this as they found AS had longer reaction times (RT) when producing alternating syllables and use simplification to reduce complexity. This explains pauses between syllable and phonemes, and consonant elongations. Both studies however have small sample sizes and aren’t generalisable across all AoS speakers. <nl>The program retrieval deficit hypothesis (PRDH) however states cognitive difficulties in AoS is due to interference in accessing articulatory plans. There is competition amongst motor programmesplans for selection due to similarity, and this generates errors and dysfluency in AoS (Mailend et al, 2019). This is supported by Mailend &amp; Maas (2013) who found AS showed significantly longer RT to say a pre-specified word when distractors were presented. Moreover, Galluzzi et al (2015) found frequency effects may be due to errors of selection due to an intrusion of phonetic  competitors; this interference activates corresponding phonetic words. In another study Mailend et al (2019) contrasted RBCH with PRDH. AS in their study were expected to show longer RT when prime and target words were different compared to identical (switch-costs). They found the switch-cost was more significant compared to other groups, as predicted by the PRDH, not the RBCH. However, this may be  due to participants knowing the target prior, which could jumpstart activation or from interference from competitors activated by the prime. Deger &amp; Ziegler (2002) found AS took longer to initiate two different syllables ‘da-ba’ compared to identical syllable sequence (da-da), which RBCH cannot explain as the ‘da’ is loaded to the buffer first and identical. <nl>In conclusion, there are numerous accounts explaining cognitive difficulties in AoS. All accounts above can propose for groping and have similaritiescontrasts of their perspectives of why impairments occur in AS.  However, experimental tasks aforementioned are limited as results may differ ranging from the severity of impairments, as brain damage and addition of Aphasia in some speakers could yield different results.

{"id": "484a4416-617d-4f0f-a622-e4c33d0b34f5", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Johns Case: <nl>John is an 18-year-old male university student living by himself, diagnosed with Atopic Dermatitis (AD) as a baby and Asthma at the age of 5 following a respiratory infection. He is prescribed preventer and reliever inhalers for his asthma. He is currently having respiratory issues such as wheezing, coughing and difficulty breathing which becomes more apparent during rugby. He reports trouble sleeping, anxiety and stress and feeling depressed, making studies become a struggle and he currently copes by distracting himself and is thinking about quitting university and moving back home. John experienced an asthma attack recently too which has led to his self-isolation behaviour due to feeling embarrassed. From my understanding his flareups in both conditions have become severe noted by the effect on his life, without control over his conditions his stress has turned chronic which signifies an impaired hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (Dhabhar, 2006; Guilliams &amp; Edwards, 2010).<nl><nl>Quality of life &amp; Mental Health: <nl>John’s quality of life (QOL) and mental health are intertwined, and they have both recently plummeted, every aspect of John’s daily life is affected. The association of asthmaAD and poor QOL is well notarised (Holm et al, 2006; Hossny et al, 2017; Miadich et al, 2015; Stucky et al,2015). Quality of life can be defined as ability to perform everyday activities and satisfaction with levels of functioning and control of diseaserelated symptoms with regards to physical, psychological and social well-being (Gotay &amp; Moore, 1992).<nl>Arguably the biggest QOL issue is his lack of sleep due to trouble breathing and itching symptoms from AD. Research has shown experiences of sleep disturbances are significantly associated with uncontrolled asthma and AD severity, exactly like john’s case (Jeon et al, 2017; Sundbom et al, 2018). Sleep is essential for energy and cognitive recovery, memory consolidation, muscle recovery and without sufficient sleep you are at a heightened risk of depressive disorders and even psychosis (Nutt et al, 2008; Walker, 2017; Waters et al, 2018). The lack of sleep may account for Johns experiences as he struggles with studies and he reports finding it difficult to look after himself by which we could infer to mean eating properly, basic hygiene andor managing his AD all of which would need the energy to do so.<nl>John’s decreased QOL can also be noted in rugby as he mentions he is out of breath quickly and his recent experience of an asthma attack; this follows trend with research as although exercise can be effective in asthma control and improving lung function this is only under circumstances of aerobic training not in the circumstance of rugbysports which can be actually asthma inducing like it is with John (Hansen et al, 2020; Kojima et al, 2009). Not only is John not enjoying it due to the troubles he is having, but it may be a contributing factor to his asthma getting worse. Although, the research for exercise induced asthma looked at children aged 6-14years which is a big gap in development to John. But the idea of induced asthma is supported by Del-Giacco et al (2015), who reports breathlessness a common occurrence in endurance sports like rugby and impairments are negated only when asthma is controlled, but John is not controlling his. We can infer from the research that John is playing rugby at a high intensity as low-moderate intensity can conversely reduce asthmatic inflammation (Hossny et al, 2017).<nl>As for mental health, John is experiencing an averse psychological state, he reports stress about university, living away from home and struggling to play rugby. Stress is naturally placed given his circumstances, research shows exam periods induce stress in asthmatic students, leading to increased inflammation via bronchoconstriction (Liu et al, 2002). Although this study had a small sample of only 20 participants, it is supported through literature like Kullowatz et al (2008),  who reports stress reduces lung function directly. Furthermore, Johns AD flareups are supplementary to additional stress in what is known as the itch-scratch cycle, AD can be triggeredenhanced due to corticotropin-releasing hormones and mast cells from stressing and likewise AD itself is then inducing flareups by altering the skin barrier making John feel more stressed (Arck &amp; Paus, 2006; Arndt et al, 2008).<nl><nl>John is affected by feelings of anxiousness and worry too, about his time management and exam performance. Exam anxiety is a common experience for many, and research has found 20-25% of college students experience it (Ergene, 2003; Thomas et al, 2017). However, that being said, John’s feelings of anxiety and worry are likely exacerbated given his conditions, research shows AD is likely to generate anxiety due to itching and perceived social stigmatisation (Chrostowska-Plak et al, 2012). Likewise, there are strong significant associations between asthma and anxiety disorderscurrent anxiety (Del-Giacco et al, 2016). Despite this, an issue in the latter study is that in half the cases anxiety preceded asthma, we cannot comment on whether Johns anxiety is caused by his asthma becoming severe nor on whether he has developed an anxiety disorder or if he is simply just feeling anxiousness currently. <nl>John is also experiencing depressive mood; this is highly predictive from intensity of daily stressors and research has found anxiety disorders have 20-40% co-morbidity overlap with depressive disorders (D’Angelo &amp; Wiekzbicki, 2003; Huppert, 2008). But likewise, with points above without standardised measurements we cannot say whether John meets the criteria for mood disorder diagnoses. Alongside these correlations, Johns conditions themselves are associated with low mooddepressive symptoms (Kim et al, 2015; Zielinksi et al, 2000) .The sample in the study for AD being especially noteworthy, having used matched control participants and finding significance whilst controlling for many lifestyle variables. In summation, both literature and the case study signal an issue of low, depressive mood.<nl><nl>Coping:<nl>John reports coping by suppressing thoughts and distracting himself with TV and videogames. Considering the perspective of the transactional model of stress and coping, it seems John on the contrary is not  actually ‘coping’ as noted by his reports of him stressing instead (Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1987). His behaviour itself is anxiety based and would be deemed mal-adaptive, he is directly avoiding his problems via distractions and doing so this may also play a part in further stress generation as noted by Holahan et al (2005). Not only is the avoidance increasing Johns difficulties but so is his attempt to suppress his thoughts, research shows that suppressing thoughts does change your expressive behaviour but does not affect your emotional experience (Cutuli, 2014). Johns attempt to cope only gets worse as in the case study it mentions him wanting to quit  university and move back home, this signifies a deeper plunge into avoidance.<nl>In theorising why John is primarily using avoidance and suppression, we can infer two things, that John believes he has no control over his situationconditions, as reported earlier John is actively isolating himself and needs social support. Humphreys et al (2011) found via focus groups that those with asthma, centralised coping on social support rather than controlling their symptoms, however john has moved out and does not have his mom to be his social support anymore and is self-isolating from friends. We infer he is dealing with feelings of helplessness as a result of not being able to cope his normal way. The idea of helplessness is not a new idea in johns’ case, a report on AD specifically found feelings of helplessness and also anxious-depressive mood which can be seen with John (Schut et al, 2014). <nl><nl>Interventions:<nl>The psychological path to solving Johns intricate case of mental and physical health issues cannot deny the invaluable significance of medication found for both asthma and AD (Atherton, 2003; Ram et al, 2001). Furthermore, even accounting the sheer variance of psychological therapies, psychology has come up with limited evidence to treat physical symptoms of asthma and  has  little to no ability in changing medication adherence as noted by meta analyses, psychology as a standalone will be ineffective to treat Johns physical symptoms from asthma (Nieuwlaat et al, 2014;Smith &amp; Jones, 2015). However, for AD there is significant findings of the effect of psychology therapy such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) on severity, itching intensity and scratching (Chida et al, 2007).<nl>Albeit the best recommendation is for a multidisciplinary approach to Johns case supported by research in asthma-related hospital admissions and management of AD (Burke et al, 2016; LeBovidge et al, 2016). Whereby John receives 5-9 1hourweekly CBT sessions for his anxiety, stress, and AD from us, research has found significant improvements in asthma specific QOL, stress and depression (Parry et al, 2012; Grover et al, 2007). Furthermore, given improvements in all those dimensions we can expect anxiety to reduce in correlation <nl>The other parts of the multidisciplinary team could support him via social care for isolation and medication via allergygp services. Lastly, it may also be informative for John to be told about options of digital SMS interventions for example where he would receive a text to remind him to take his preventer inhaler, found to improve medication adherence (Chan et al, 2018).", "nks for the answers, really clarified a lot of things! <nl><nl> <nl><nl>To decide on the specific personality traits I wish to study, I've summarised the traits that each study looks at in a table.

{"id": "03874e70-0569-4066-a31c-1b7677e6c6a8", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Background<nl><nl>Specsavers, founded in 1984 by Doug and Mary Perkins, is the world’s largest privately-owned optical group, (Corporate Eyecare - about us | Specsavers UK, 2020) with 1,845 stores operating in 10 countries. (Experience Specsavers - Working at Specsavers - Specsavers People, 2020) Specsavers operates on a joint venture partnership, with each store owned and operated by local partners, who are qualified opticians. These partners are committed to delivering the highest standard of customer service. <nl><nl>Definition of the Business Problem<nl><nl>Specsavers stores, along with any other opticians, deal with interactions on a daily basis, whether it be in-store or via telephone. However, a lot of the time, these interactions are related to minor queries such as bookingre-arrangingcancelling appointments, checking upcoming appointment details, requesting prescriptions, or checking if glasses are in stock. <nl><nl>Currently, the option to book appointments online via the store website and cancel via the email sent regarding appointment booking confirmation is available. This has lowered the number of calls and walk-ins by a significant amount however there are still a large number of individuals who are unaware of this option. Consequently, time is taken up during the day.<nl>The directors of stores are constantly seeking ways of improving customer service. To do this, they need to understand how effective technology is in providing individuals with more freedom and the access to information from any location without having to visit or call a store. The research findings will be used to review and improve the technology.<nl><nl>Research Objectives<nl>The key question this research should answer therefore is:<nl>• How would the launch of an app benefit or worsen customers experiences and overall interactions with Specsavers?<nl><nl>Target Population<nl><nl>The target profile identified is as follows:<nl>• Customers who own a smartphone device<nl>• Customers who visit Specsavers<nl>• ‘Direct Debit’ scheme patients<nl>• Individuals who wear glasses andor contact lenses<nl>Research Design and Strategy<nl><nl>Based on the research objectives, it is recommended that a quantitative research design is implemented through the use of online questionnaires. Questionnaires are a \"set of questions designed to produce the data needed in order to meet the research objectives\" (McDaniel and Gates, 2018). The aim of this research is: \"To gain an insight into individuals’ preferences as to whether or not they believe they would benefit from the launch of an app.\" The questionnaire will consist of various questions where the participant will rate their opinion using a Likert scale: \"A measurement scale where the respondent indicates a level of agreement or disagreement to the given statements…\" (McDaniel and Gates, 2018). An example of the questionnaire is shown by appendix 1.<nl><nl>This method is most favourable as the sample population is large. Other survey methods such as telephone interviews or face-to-face interviews are time consuming as they require an individual (usually an experienced interviewer) to contact the participant and have a conversation with them. Therefore, for this research it is impractical. It is advised having a sample size of n=400, however, having a read of n=80 or above for each subgroup will allow to draw strong conclusions. The advantage is that it will be easier to analyse results amongst the subgroups specified in the target population. Quantitative methods aim for conclusiveness and generalisability. Therefore, once there is solid evidence to support the question, no further testing is required.<nl><nl>Sampling Approach<nl><nl>The most appropriate sampling technique is cluster sampling. This technique is part of \"probability sampling where the population is divided into groups\" (McDaniel and Gates, 2018) and then randomly sampled from each group. This is the preferred method as it allows to select an equal number of participants per group, allowing for fairness and reliability. Cluster sampling involves gathering the entire population of the study and dividing them into clusters. Each cluster is a representation of the entire population. Once the clusters have been identified, certain clusters will be chosen using simple random sampling. Only the participants who meet one or more of the ‘Target Population\" criteria will be used for the study. The unchosen clusters (those who do not meet the criteria) will remain unrepresented in the study. For this study, participants will be grouped by age, and then participants will be chosen randomly to be included in the data analysis. 100 participants per age group will be selected to allow fairness.  <nl><nl><nl><nl>Data Collection Method and Analysis<nl><nl>As mentioned previously, online questionnaires will be used due to the type of research being conducted and the size of the target sample population. Questionnaires will be sent out to every individual who has provided an e-mail address to Specsavers and given consent to receive the questionnaire. Online questionnaires allow the researcher to contact multiple participants at once. As a result, they have higher response rates as well as the ability to contact the hard-to-reach. Moreover, it is quick to create and allows for adaptability and personalisation of questions. There are no physical materials needed to send the questionnaire (paper, envelope etc.) so there are fewer expenses incurred. There may also be less bias as without an interviewer present, respondents are able to answer truthfully. Additionally, anonymity also encourages truthful answers.<nl><nl>Respondents will be given 4 weeks to complete the questionnaire from the date of visit to the store. Once completed, the results will be put onto a spreadsheet categorised by age (groups of 10 years). Once all 400 responses have been recorded, it will be analysed by calculating the averages of each question. This will help identify what customers prefer or not. For example, an average score of 1-3 shows customers disagree with the statements, 4 shows they are neutral, and a score between 5-7 means they agree. The ratings will give a good indication on whether it is beneficial to launch the app, and what features should be included.<nl><nl>A timings and costings table has been provided in the appendix (appendix 2) to highlight a more detailed overview of the length of the research project (3 months) and the total cost of the research project (£28,000). <nl><nl>Ethical Issues<nl><nl>There are many ethical principles regarding the use of online surveys, the most important one being informed consent – participants within reason know what they are going to be doing. In addition, participation should be voluntary and anonymous. Questions should also avoid physical and psychological harm to the participants. All measures have been taken to ensure ethical principles have been followed. For example, informed consent will happen when customers arrive for their appointment. They will be asked whether they would like to partake in an online survey. If answered yes, only then will an e-mail containing the survey be sent.", "<addr5_FN>,<nl><nl>Hope you are well.

However, it’s brutal depiction of mental illness means there are differing responses to the text. ‘Reader response data’ has become a popular way for researchers to identify how a reader places themselves in relation to a text through assessing their responses to said text. <nl>This study will assess how reviews from the open access website ‘Good Reads’ align themselves to The Shock of the Fall’s protagonist and overall narrative. Oatley’s (1999) theory of \"identification\" or \"observer\" will be drawn upon for this purpose, as well as Stockwell’s (2009) discussion of reading metaphors, so that commonalities can emerge to determine factors that cause alignment with the text. To compliment these theories, language analysis more generally will be utilised in order to collectively lead to an understanding of reader positioning within the data sets.<nl><nl>Literature Review<nl>The Shock of the Fall by Nathan Filer is a piece of experimental fiction portraying the deteriorating mind of the protagonist, Matthew. McCarthy-Jones (2018) praises Filer for his \"beautiful\" form and word choice, whilst Armstrong (2014, 173) highlights the brilliant use of \"complex narrative structure\" and experimental use of \"graphics and fonts\". Moreover, Armstrong argues that the novel is brilliant both in its insightful portrayal of the family bond, but also in its depictions of mental health. Similarly, Rajasingam (2014) believes the novel depicts the inpatient experience with such accuracy that it could be beneficial for junior doctors to understand the bleak realities of these unique situations. This accurate depiction is most likely down to Filer’s personal experience as a psychiatric nurse (Sanai 2014), as he was seemingly able to amalgamate his previous experience to create the protagonist, Matthew.<nl>This study utilises reader response data. Reader response data is seen as a \"rigorous and evidence based\" approach to understanding reader interactions with a text (Whiteley and Canning 2017). Fish (1970) discusses how a text comes into being through reader interaction. Therefore, reader response data allows us to seek, understand and interpret reader’s interactions with certain texts through different means, which is why it is utilised within this research to determine factors of alignment within reader reviews. <nl>The basis of this research surrounds Oatley’s (1995;1999) theory discussing alignment with a text. Oatley (1999) argues there are two positions a reader adopts; \"identification\" or \"observer\". He believes that the observer is a spectator role, in which we are an objective outsider in a narrative, whereas identification occurs when a reader aligns themselves with the protagonist, taking on their goals and emotions. Moreover, he argues that a first-person narrative favours identification, whereas third-person narratives favour the spectatorobserver role. Identification is therefore seen as an intense alignment with the protagonist, with Oatley stating we \"become that person\" in the narrative (Oatley 1999, 446), made ever more present if the reader can sympathise with the protagonist through personal experience (Oatley 1995). However, it is important to note that these alignments are part of a scale where readers have autonomy, as opposed to having a fixed state in one position.  <nl>To analyse the position of identification or observer, one of the methods I will be using is metaphor analysis. Lakoff and Johnson’s (1980) ‘conceptual metaphor theory’ highlights how we better understand an entity when it is described in relation to another. It shows how metaphors can be \"extended\", allowing us to map the meaning within a metaphor in order to gauge the full detail of the comparison. Dirven et al (2003) highlight the significance of the theory, arguing conceptual metaphor theory ignited the importance of metaphor for our understanding of knowledge. Metaphors are useful in conjunction with noticing the identifierobserver role, as the way a reader discusses their experience of reading is often linked to their level of submersion and alignment with the protagonist and the text. <nl>Stockwell (2009) and Gerrig (1993) discuss metaphors more centred around reading. Stockwell (extending knowledge outlined by Gerrig) discusses metaphors that can be used by readers to describe their reading experience. These include \"reading is a journey\", \"reading as transport\" and \"reading as control\" (Stockwell 2009, 80-81). Stockwell (2005, 144) believes critical theorists should \"engage with the texture of the text\", which allows us to read as one does when they are simply reading for enjoyment; a \"natural reader\". With ‘Good Reads’ being a platform for mostly natural readers, we can see how utilising this method will allow inferences for reader position to emerge, as the reviewers discuss their experiences in a natural way, therefore giving their natural alignment with the text. <nl>I will also be drawing on conceptions of ‘stake inoculation’ and ‘category entitlement’ within my analysis. Stake inoculation can be identified when a reader is not presenting a vested interest in a text, and has been described as readers wanting to be \"regarded as considered, reasoned and neutral\" (Peplow 2011, 306). Category entitlement, however, is defined as when certain people in specific situations are given authority for their knowledge in a specific area (Potter 1996). These features can be linked to the need to keep a \"positive face\" that is protected and maintained with the social space (Potter 1996; Goffman 1967). Reviewers may use stake inoculation andor category entitlement in order to portray themselves in a positive light for other reviewers, especially because the site is seen as a \"social network for book reviews\" (Fay 2012). <nl><nl>Methodology<nl>I began my naturalistic study by sourcing reviews from the open access website ‘Good Reads’; a book reviewing website. This website was useful as it allows users to interact with reviews through ‘likes’, as well as having a rating system (one to five stars) to review the book discussed. As a result, I was able to find the most ‘liked’ reviews within each rating category. By choosing the most ‘liked’ reviews, the assumption can be made that the views described within the review reflect the majority, as they were the most widely interacted with. <nl>After selecting the most liked review from each rating category, I anonymised each review, by naming them R1 (being the review with a one-star rating) to R5 (being the review with a five-star rating), ensuring no ethical issues in relation to confidentiality could occur (See Appendix for full reviews). I then used ‘NVivo’; a form of qualitative data analysis software, to begin my analysis. I ‘coded’ each review in NVivo, which then highlighted areas where there were common themes among each review. This allowed me to make inferences as to the common themes that link to identificationobservation (Oatley 1999) within each of the rating categories. <nl><nl>Analysis<nl>Comparing uses of Category Entitlement:<nl>One of the most common themes across all of the reviews is category entitlement. All of the reviewers, in one way or another, highlighted their authority within their review. The interesting part about comparing the uses of category entitlement is the difference in tone that occurs depending on how positive or negative the review is. The more negative reviews use this device in order to depict how The Shock of The Fall was a bad novel, because they identified better with certain other novels (R1 and R2). Whereas, the more positive reviews show their identification with The Shock of The Fall by providing examples of other mental health literature that has also made them feel this way (R3, R4 and R5). For example, R5 states they have read \"a number of books regarding mental illness\", but describes this text as \"purely unique\". On the other hand, R1 argues \"I would never recommend this book considering the wealth of options available to readers […]\". Peplow et al (2015, 75) discuss how you can put yourself forward as having \"expert knowledge\", which can be seen through the intentional discussion of broader knowledge. However, they also discuss how readers can \"play down\" their entitlement, which is also present through the subtle portrayals of wider reading as opposed to more direct mentions of expert knowledge (Peplow et al 2015, 74). As ‘Good Reads’ is a platform that invites avid readers, one could argue that a participant of the site would likely house a level of category entitlement simply due to this fact, and therefore their broad knowledge of literature would most likely be conveyed within their reviews, intentionally or not. Moreover, the fact that the website has open access means some reviewers may want to portray, and maintain, a ‘positive face’ (Potter 1996; Goffman 1967), which can be achieved through the use of category entitlement. Therefore, the comparative aspect category entitlement allows the users to present their identificationobservation with the text.<nl>Although in another breadth of mental illness, a study into the effects of reading novels about eating disorders showed participants felt their mood and self-confidence diminished, whilst other genres improved their mood (Troscianko 2018). Despite being about a very different aspect of mental health, I believe these findings highlight how the genre one chooses to focus on can have such ingrained effects on themselves as a reader. In a similar way to Oatley’s (1995) statement about how a reader identifies more intensely if they can empathise with a reader from their personal experience, you could argue that reading fiction of this genre highlights how different forms of mental health literature ignite different reactions for certain individuals. Where the more positive reviews name novels that depict mental health in a way that has \"fascinated\" them (R4) and highlight their appreciation for such literature (R5, R3), the more negative reviews could arguably be having a similar reaction to that laid out in the study mentioned (Troscianko 2018) through their preference of other mental health literature (R2), therefore showing the use of comparison to determine alignment with the text. As the readers all portray themselves to have a broad knowledge of literature, we can see how a novel of such unique nature could create conflicting responses depending on the reviewers individual understanding and perceptions of mental health literature more generally. Therefore, we can see that all of the reviews utilise category entitlement as a device to compare The Shock of the Fall to other texts of a similar vein, which therefore portrays their level of observationidentification depending on how they ‘rank’ this text compared to others they discuss. <nl>Emotive vs Clinical Language – Comparing uses of Reading Metaphors and Stake Inoculation:<nl>Reading metaphors (Stockwell 2009; Gerrig 1993) are an insightful way to decipher the identificationobserver positioning. Stockwell (2009,80) identifies a number of metaphors commonly used by readers; reading is \"transport\", reading is \"control\", and reading is \"investment\". As these responses can be aligned more directly with an investment with the reading material, it isn’t entirely unsurprising that the two top rated reviews are the only reviews which give examples of this use of metaphor. The more positive reviews actively present themselves as having an identification stance through their use of reading metaphors. R5 described being \"grabbed\" and \"held\" by the book, providing an example of the \"reading as control\" metaphor that Stockwell (2009, 80) discusses. As this is the most highly rated review, which speaks very positively about the novel as a whole, is it not surprising that the reader feels so invested in the narrative. However, despite R4 being mostly positive, the metaphors used within their review do not reflect their identification in the same way. R4 utilises \"reading as transport\" (Stockwell 2009, 80) through feelings of being lost in the narrative; \"at times you have to try and remember where you are\", as well as describing the narrative as \"following\" the narrator. Here, the use of metaphor seems to have less intensity; they are not being controlled in the same sense that R5 describes. However, there is still a clear alignment presented, as the reviewer is situated within the narrative for the feeling of being \"lost\" to occur. Although \"following\" for R4 is not as intense of a description as \"grabbed\" and \"held\" in R5, we can see that there is still a level of alignment that is arguably understandable from their different review ratings (as R4 rated the novel slightly lower than R5). Their difference also highlights Oatley’s argument that aligning with a text is part of a scale, therefore R4 simply isn’t as far on the ‘identification scale’ as R5. Therefore, we can see that the use of metaphor for the more positive reviews shows the level of identification that the readers feel through their embodiment of the text. <nl>On the other hand, it is interesting how some of the negative reviews use stake inoculation, which directly contrasts the intense feeling described by the reading metaphors portrayed in the positive reviews. Where the positive reviewers use metaphor in order to portray an alignment with the text, R3 and R2 speak about the same harrowing events within the novel, yet do not use the same language to describe the experience. R2 states very blatantly \"Matt is haunted by his dead brother\", whilst R3 states \"This is an interesting read that deals with mental illness, more particularly schizophrenia, as a result of a boy’s grief over the death of his older brother.\". Where other more positive reviews have discussed the physical grip and transportation that the portrayal of the protagonist’s mental health had on them, we can see with R2 and R3 that there is a very clinical, blunt approach to discussing the topic. Stake inoculation is about a portrayal of being \"considered, reasoned and neutral\" (Peplow 2011, 306), which, when discussing mental health, shows why some who wish to portray themselves in this way would use such clinical language to describe the text. Peplow (2011) discusses how a reader’s positive face can be at risk if they engage in explaining their personal interpretation of a text due to judgement from other readers, therefore this could indicate why some of the reviewers, on a site that is based so largely on user interaction, could use stake inoculation as a means to deter this judgement. <nl>The stark comparison between the positive and negative reviews shows how having an identification stance clearly impacts your perception of a text, as those that do identify describe their reading experience with so much more intensity. On the other hand, the clinical approach of the negative reviews highlights that they simply observed the events without gaining any form of attachment to the protagonist or his struggles, giving a fairly alternate reading experience. <nl>Perceptions of Accuracy:<nl>The majority of the reviews comment on Filer’s accurate depiction of mental health within the novel, arguing his background as a psychiatric nurse enhanced his ability to portray expert knowledge on the topic. Therefore, we can see, even within the negative reviews, one of the main praises is through this depiction of accuracy. However, the important distinction between the positive and negative reviews, despite all of them praising the accurate depiction, is that some reviews can empathise with the accurate depiction, whereas others can simply appreciate. The most negative review, R1, states their appreciation for the accuracy very blatantly; \"…it presents a very realistic glimpse of what mental illness looks and feels like\". Here we see no language that attaches the reader to the narrative; they are embodying the essence of an observer role. R2 is less clinical in language, yet still places themselves outside of the story world; \"You do get a very strong sense of the mental bind that some patients… get into once they’re sucked into the mental health biz…\". R2 is very informal throughout, therefore their discussion of the accuracy continues this informal language to convey their observer position. This review uses emotive language to describe the actual events of the novel (\"mental bind\", \"sucked into\"), but this language is solely attached to the narrative and not their emotions in relation to said narrative. Similar to the use of stake inoculation discussed previously, the clinical language is used within the more negative reviews as a means to distance themselves from the narrative. Therefore, we can see that again, with such a sensitive topic, the clinical language allows these reviewers to avoid being seen as prejudice (Peplow 2011) by simply outlining events as opposed to exposing their own opinions of said events.<nl>On the other hand, with the more positive reviews, the accuracy only seemed to add to their levels of identification. R5 states \"He [Filer] does not idealise the staff or the patients, both of them have good days and bad days and this was remarkably refreshing.\". Moreover, R3 states \"It is a daring but successful endeavour on the part of the author to unravel the tangled world a person with schizophrenia lives in.\". Here, we can see that identificationobservation is part of a scale, as both the most highly rated review and the neutral review use emotive language which signifies identification. R3’s use of emotive language (\"daring\", \"unravel\", \"tangled\") in isolation invite the assumption of heightened identification, but when we assess within the entire review, this isn’t the case. Whereas R5 discusses the accuracy in the expected manner due to their consistent identification. Oatley (1999) believes first-person narratives invite more of an \"identification\" role, which is reflected within these reviews. Those that do identify can be seen to enter the story world and therefore take on the emotions of the protagonist, meaning the accurate depiction seemingly made this embodiment even more intense. Moreover, Oatley (1995) argues that emotions arise whenif a reader can empathise with the story characters and their struggles, particularly from personal experience, which could indicate why some reviews discuss the text with such identification; if a reader has had personal experiences that are similar to the protagonist, they may be able to identify more heavily than someone who cannot relate in the same way. <nl>When we assess the discussion of accuracy from all of the reviewers, we can see that accuracy as a feature within a novel does not create a heightened level of observation or identification, but instead can be analysed as a discussion point to assess the position of observationidentification. In other words, in some cases it is important to see how readers discuss aspects of a text, as opposed to the specific aspect itself. With this example, language analysis is the focal device to understand the identificationobserver role, as well as highlighting how alignment with a text causes fairly distinctive differences in perceptions of key themes. <nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>Despite using a small data set, I believe there is clear evidence about the factors that indicate the identificationobserver role in relation to The Shock of the Fall, and therefore the aim of this research has been met. It emerged that the positive reviews had identification with the text (seen through emotive language and use of metaphor), and the negative reviews were more observational (seen through stake inoculation and clinical language). However, the slight inconsistencies of these patterns highlight Oatley’s argument that identificationobservation is part of a scale as opposed to two polarised positions. Should this research be extended with a larger data set, I believe more evidence would arise to reflect this scale, and present that not all negative reviews are entirely observational, and not all positive reviews show identification. <nl>It seems the best device to assess the identificationobservation within the reviews was language analysis. The comparison between the different reviews showed that it isn’t necessarily the presence of certain linguistic factors (for example category entitlement), but the discussion of such that show reader positioning; language analysis shows the device as an entity does not lead to an understanding of reader position, but the way it is utilised does. <nl>", "<addr4_FN>,<nl><nl>Thank you for your consideration and well wishes. <nl><nl>Best wishes,<nl><part_FN><new>Hi,<nl><nl>I was writing in the hope to get my CV checked.

{"id": "bdc18ff9-2e8b-4ae5-a181-70a1955fe6f2", "discourse_types": ["essay", "text_message"], "pair": ["Rational choice theory ‘deals with the way in which scarcity impinges upon the individual consumer and hence deals with the way in which such an individual makes choices’ (Estrin et al., 2012). The model is ‘predicated on the notion that individual actors purse goals efficiently’ (Outhwaite et al., 2007). The term Homo Economicus is used to describe consumers and their sole aim of ‘utility maximisation’ (Fine., 2016). In-kind and unconditional cash transfers can be used by governments to aim to raise utility and welfare of specific groups in an economy. The effectiveness of these methods may depend upon many factors such as the target group of consumers, the area of consumption they aim to impact and the monetary value of the intervention.<nl><nl>An in-kind transfer is a ‘transfer payment’ that is ‘made in a specific good or service rather than cash’ (Cengage.com., 2013). There are 3 main types of in-kind transfers; the provision of vouchers such as food stamps, the use of subsidies and providing free access to a good or service, for example, the NHS in the UK. In-kind transfers allocate the benefit provided to specific goods or services, for example, the UK Healthy start scheme provides a targeted group with ‘vouchers that can only be spent on specific healthy foods’ (Griffith et al., 2018). It was found the impact these vouchers had upon raising utility depended on how highly the consumer values healthy foods. Diagram 1 shows the impact a healthy food voucher has upon infra-marginal consumers.<nl><figure><nl>Infra-marginal consumers already spend more than the vouchers worth on healthy foods as they value these goods highly and therefore a steep indifference curve is used. They are willing to sacrifice a high proportion of other goods to gain a small extra amount of healthy foods. In the diagram, the food voucher is represented by the line A-C. The voucher has caused an increase in utility for the consumer as represented by the rightward shift in the indifference curve from U1 to U2. The original point of maximum utility is represented by point X and the new higher maximum utility point is represented by point Y. The provision of food vouchers to infra-marginal consumers has positively impacted utility. Whilst utility has increased, the impact the voucher has had upon these consumers is very ‘similar to an income-equivalent cash benefit’ (Griffith et al., 2018). This means that providing an unconditional cash transfer to these consumers instead of the vouchers would have a similar effect on utility. They are still likely to spend the additional cash on healthy foods.<nl><nl>On the other hand, distorted consumers do not value healthy foods as highly and therefore the voucher has a different effect upon their utility. Diagram 2 displays the effect of the food voucher upon distorted consumers.<nl><figure><nl>The lower utility received from consuming healthy foods is represented by a flatter indifference curve and this displays the lower marginal rate of substitution. This means that in comparison to diagram 1 the initial maximum utility point X occurs at a much lower quantity of healthy foods. The voucher causes a shift in the indifference curve from U1 to U2 and therefore increases the utility from point X to point C. This shows that the vouchers are effective in raising utility for this group of consumers. However, the line C-E represents the cash alternative of the voucher. Here we can see that if these consumers were provided with cash instead of vouchers the higher maximum utility point of Y can be reached. This shows that these consumers are unlikely to purchase healthy foods if provided with a cash alternative to the vouchers. They would instead choose to purchase a variety of other goods and services. For distorted consumers, the food vouchers are less effective in raising utility and the consumers would prefer to receive a cash payment.<nl><nl>Unconditional cash transfer programmes ‘aim to improve well-being by providing cash to targeted poor households without placing any conditions on the household’s actions’ (Institute for Financial Studies., 2018). Consumers are therefore not restricted on how they spend this money. Providing consumers with additional cash to spend effectively increases their income. The rational choice model assumes that consumers will act rationally and use any additional income to maximise utility. However, behavioural economics challenges this and suggests that the use of labels for these cash payments can influence how the consumer spends this additional money. Behavioural economics ‘adds elements of psychology to traditional models in an attempt to gain a better understanding of decision making’ (Sloman et al., 2018). For example, the UK Winter Fuel payment is a ‘cash transfer to older households’ (Beatty et al., 2014). ‘Robust evidence of a behavioural effect of labelling’ (Beatty et al., 2014) was found in relation to this unconditional cash transfer. The study found that ‘on average households spend 47% of the WFP on fuel’ (Beatty et al., 2014). This is in comparison to an expected 3% being spent on fuel if the payment was simply treated as cash. Behavioural economic tools such as nudges can be used to alter how consumers spend their income. This is a clear example of nudge theory and shows that ‘positive reinforcement’ ‘can persuade people to make a particular choice’ (Sloman et al., 2018). ‘When a label is attached to a part of their budget, subjects change consumption according to the label’ (Abler et al., 2017). This evidence shows that consumers are responsive to behavioural economic policies and therefore do not always act like Homo Economicus as suggested by the rational choice model.<nl><nl>Overall, rational choice theory suggests that unconditional cash transfers are more effective at raising consumers’ utility. It allows consumers to purchase the goods and services they decide will maximise their own utility. However, in the long run, depending upon the area of consumption being targeted in-kind transfers may be more beneficial for raising overall welfare. For example, the healthy food vouchers provide families with food of a higher quality and that is more beneficial to their health. If they were instead provided with cash, as the distorted consumer example shows, there is a chance that this money would not be spend on healthy foods and instead it may be used to purchase fast food alternatives. This is then likely to have a long-term impact on health and could contribute to strains on the healthcare system in the future. If unconditional cash transfers are to be used, behavioural economic approaches can be adopted to influence how consumers spend this money to enable the intervention to have the most desired impact.", "�<new>Won’t be long x<new>Awake by 8:30 please x<new>Mind furniture collection has arrived!!

{"id": "dfcea237-aed7-4cf8-8350-53b247b90587", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Georg Simmel was a classical social theorist interested in alternative social phenomena to theorists like Marx and Durkheim, such as the artistic personality and fashion (Stones, 2007:91). This resulted in Simmel not being taken as a serious social theorist by many academics despite the relevance of his work. The majority of Simmel’s ideas can be regarded as more applicable to modern society than the period Simmel was writing in as the social matters he wrote about, such as fashion, are a larger part of culture in modern society. Simmel’s ideas surrounding the role of fashion in social interaction are valuable in understanding how fashion is important within culture and social interaction in modern society as he argued fashion is functional for social purposes (Gronow,1993:89). Simmel’s arguments allow us to understand how fashion builds social ties within groups and how it allows an individual to express their individuality. In addition, his work allows us to analyse how fashion can help us understand differences between social classes and genders within a modern society by analysing how social groups use fashion as an expression of status. However, although Simmel’s ideas about the role of fashion are relevant today some of his arguments are restricted in their ability to be applied to modern society due to developments within social structure and divisions between social groups since the time he was writing. Nevertheless, his arguments are still valuable to understand the role of fashion in social interaction in modern society. <nl>Simmel believed that fashion was a \"form of imitation\" (Simmel, 1957:541), he argued that individuals imitate the fashion trends set by others which then results in the trend being spread throughout society. His discussion that fashion itself is a \"form of imitation\" (Simmel, 1957:541) is relevant as a certain style does not become a fashion trend until people start to imitate and adopt the fashion trends set by an individual or a brand which then creates a community of followers who all follow the same trends. Furthermore, his ideas are relevant to modern society as people imitate the fashion trends set by influencers and celebrities within the media as they are whom people aspire to be like. Within modern society brands now employ what is referred to as a brand ambassador which is an individual with a following who will advertise certain fashion trends which members of society then adopt and imitate (Calhoun, 2012:372) in order to feel like they fit into society. For example, girls may aspire to imitate the fashion trends set by the Kardashians as they view them as role models or desire to be like them but when too many people adopt these trends new ones emerge and old ones are abandoned. Therefore, it is evident that Simmel’s idea that fashion is a form of imitation is relevant to modern society. However, Simmel then goes on to discuss how this creates a conflict between the need to express individuality and the need to be accepted (Helle, 2012:49). This argument is relevant as the fashion trends individuals chose to imitate are an expression of their individuality but these trends then categorise them into a social group creating a conflict between the need to stand out and the need to be accepted, Simmel later discusses this in relation to acceptance. Consequently, Simmel’s ideas surrounding the role of imitation are relevant to today’s society as people imitate the fashion trends set by those they aspire to be like or those they view as desirable as they want to be socially accepted. <nl>In addition to this, Simmel also discusses how fashion builds social ties through the acceptance and rejection of individuals to social groups. Simmel argues that if an individual adopts the fashion trends of a group that they are trying to gain access to they are more likely to gain acceptance from the ingroup members as they share something in common by carrying the same fashion trends. Therefore, fashion provides a bridge between an individual and a group (Dollhopf, 2011:5) as it helps the individual to build social ties. This is still valuable in understanding the role of fashion in modern society as people within the same social network carry similar trends to each other and are consequently categorised the same way, for example in modern society those categorised as belonging to an ‘indie’ social group are categorised on factors such as the fashion trends they all adopt. However, this argument is only relevant to modern society in terms of the broader social categories people fall into as within the close knit groups people are more likely to associate with there is more diversity in the fashion trends of the group. This can be linked to Simmel’s discussion of fashion as an expression of individuality because within society there is much more emphasis on fashion in relation to individualism rather than fashion as an expression of status. However, although there is a conflict between the need to express ones individuality and the desire to be socially accepted (Simmel, 1957:543) fashion still allows for the acceptance of an individual to a social group as it displays a sense of similarity between members allowing for them to build social ties. Therefore, Simmel’s ideas in relation to fashion as both a facilitator of gaining acceptance into a social group and as an expression of individuality is still valuable in understanding modern society but it must be discussed that although the fashion trends an individual adopt categorises them into a broader social group it does not limit the individual to that social group as there is more emphasis on diversity within groups in modern society. Nevertheless, Simmel’s ideas are still relevant to understanding the social function of fashion in modern society. <nl>Furthermore, Simmel argues that there is a relationship between fashion and social class divisions. He discusses how fashion provides a distinction between the upper and lower classes as it allows for the expression of status against the lower class as the trends the upper classes adopt aren’t as easily accessible to the lower classes due to their economic position. In addition, he also discusses how fashion unifies the upper class by providing them with a collective dominance over the lower class (Simmel, 1957:541). This argument is valuable in understanding the social function of fashion in modern society as we see the continued division between social classes through the fashion trends they can access as the upper classes have the facilities to purchase the upmarket expensive trends of the wealthy whereas the lower classes are still limited to the fashion trends they can buy into, for example brands such as Gucci are more accessible to the upper classes due to their financial status. Simmel goes on to then discuss how once the fashion trends the upper classes have set are adopted by the lower classes the trends will then be abandoned and new trends will be established (Calhoun, 2012:372). This argument is still relevant today as we observe how trends are spread from those of the upper classes such as celebrities and are then adopted by lower classes as the lower market brands start to develop clothing that fits into the upper class trends making it more accessible to the lower classes and resulting in social class divisions based on these fashion trends being less distinct. However, not all trends in modern society stem from the upper classes as we see lower market high street brands setting trends which are then adopted and are easily accessible to all classes. Despite this, Simmel’s discussion of fashion as an expression of social class status is still relevant to modern society as fashion is still limited to certain individuals based on their economic status meaning the expensive fashion trends and brands can still only be accessed by the upper classes who have the means to gain access which then creates the social class distinctions based on the fashion trends adopted by each class. Therefore, fashion has a social function of showcasing the differences between social classes and consequently their economic position as once trends become more accessible to lower classes they are then abandoned by the upper classes as they want to maintain the distinction and the dominance they have over the lower classes (Lizardo, 2019). Consequently, Simmel’s ideas regarding social class and fashion are still relevant to modern society although it must be considered that not all trends are started by members of the upper classes and that not all members of the lower class desire to access the trends of the upper class. <nl>Moreover, Simmel examines the relationship between fashion and gender. He argues that fashion is primarily associated with women as it allows them to express their individuality in the oppressed position they are in (Helle, 2012:49). This argument is relevant to understanding modern society as fashion is still greatly associated with women however this argument is limited as fashion has expanded to be more related to men as well as fashion has become important as an expression of individuality for all members of society. Particularly, fashion has gained importance in the lives of young men who take more notice of the relevant fashion trends they wish to adopt. Therefore, although it is still relevant to suggest that fashion is more associated with women as we see in the media that fashion is more targeted at women than men it cannot be denied that fashion has become much more associated with men as well as we have progressed into modern society. Furthermore, the discussion that fashion is one of the ways women express themselves as an oppressed group is limited in its relevance as although women are still viewed as an oppressed group their position in society has greatly improved since the time Simmel was writing in with modern society making a great amount of progress in regards to equality for example with more women in employment. Simmel develops this argument by suggesting fashion accommodates for lack of status women can obtain from employment (Simmel, 1957:551). This argument is outdated as the percentage of women in employment has increased since the time Simmel was writing and as has essentially equalised with the number of men in employment therefore arguing fashion accommodates for the expression of status women cannot access from employment is not relevant to modern society. However, Simmel’s idea that fashion provides a means of expression for women is relevant to understanding the social function of fashion in modern society however it is equally as important as a means for men to express themselves as women but it can be acknowledge that Simmel’s idea that fashion is more associated with women is relevant in modern society as although it has become more relevant in the lives of men it is still primarily associated with women. <nl>In conclusion, Simmel’s ideas about the social function of fashion are still valuable in understanding modern society. His arguments surrounding imitation and acceptance are still relevant as we observe people imitating trends set by those they view as desirable to copy and we see people adopting certain fashion trends to gain access to certain groups. In addition, Simmel’s discussion of fashion as an expression of individuality is valuable and relevant in understanding the role of fashion in modern society however his argument that this has a higher importance in the lives of women due to their oppressed position is limited as women have made improvements in their position and fashion has become equally as important in the lives of men. Nevertheless, his discussion of fashion as a means of expressing status between the upper and lower classes is still relevant to society today as we see upper classes starting trends and abandoning them once they are adopted by the lower classes. Consequently, Simmel’s work regarding the social function of fashion is relevant to society today as his ideas are applicable to several areas of society however it must be taken into account that some of his ideas are limited due to the developments made in society from the time Simmel was writing in.

A critical role of middle managers in strategy is sense making, as detailed in a report by Burgelman (1983) they shape the strategy of internal development and give form to the directives given from above, the Top Managers. Middle managers are the ones most directly involved with the people, products &amp; diversified groups and are therefore the impetus with which the strategy of an organisation can be implemented and developed, giving them great importance and relevance.<nl><nl>Middle managers are also implementors of strategy, one that has been developed and created by top managers, they allow for the testing of the possible flaws and failings of what has been handed down to them. Subsequently it is the middle managers again that have the responsibility and need to synthesize the information they receive while disseminating it to the top as well as operating level managers in order to facilitate the flow of information in the firm (Kuratko, 2005). This highlights the importance of middle level managers in the firm as they are in the perfect position to keep information going both ways and are able to connect top management to the lower levels of the firm which are normally very disconnected. As a result, at often times middle managers will need to ‘sell’ key issues to top management, persuading them to commit to resolving certain strategic issues they deem necessary to address. If middle level managers cannot attract the attention of senior management to fix and improve strategy this could lead to the ultimate demise of the company as a whole.<nl><nl>The eventual downfall of the mobile giant Nokia can in part be attributed to the failings of the middle managers, and the obstacles put in their way that prohibited them from completing their role as communicators and implementors of strategy. The middle managers were technological experts, the managers and their teams had a deep understanding of Symbian, the software Nokia used, it’s faults and flaws. This best placed them to give advice on what was and what wasn’t working, however the Nokia case study provides a perfect example of when communication isn’t open and positive and the aftereffects. Due to the atmosphere of fear and lack of openness, most middle managers were hesitant to mention their true feelings and communicate the problems to the top (Vuori &amp; Huy, 2016). This meant that the middle managers weren’t able to fulfil their roles, and Nokia’s fall illustrated that without them the business could not function cohesively as a unit.<nl><nl><question2><nl><nl>One of the evident issues within Nokia was that there was a great lack of trust from the Top management to the lower levels, and this trust needed to be tangible for middle managers to keep an open dialogue with senior management. In order for information to flow from the lower levels to the upper levels of an organisation trust and a sense of ontological security is necessary, middle managers need to feel like they can openly disclose failures and mistakes with top management, however this wasn’t the case in Nokia. In addition, this trust was to be harboured by top management and it was their responsibility to reduce the fear that failure would lead to punishment (Mantere, S. 2008), instead instigating and encouraging a culture of openness with a sense of security. This culture of fear of failure was not something that could be amended by middle managers but needed action from top management. Since the early 1990’s this high-pressured culture was reinforced with social and economic sanctions, which, as time moved on, further demotivated middle managers to present the real problems that were occurring within the organisation, leading to skewed information flows between the lower and higher levels.<nl><nl>The literature indicates that the motivation to sell issues to top management is based on the organisational context of the firm, the theory of Issue-selling intention as explained by Yan Ling et al. (2005) clearly highlights the underlying issues within Nokia’s management. The theory details three contextual cues that motivate middle managers to sell issues to top management: Perceived organisational support, top management’s open mindedness and relationship quality. Albeit none of these were present in Nokia. The first factor, perceived organisational support, is when employees feel safe selling issues to senior management either formally or informally. However, some at the top in Nokia were described as ‘extremely temperamental’ and seen at often times as intimidating, threatening to fire those that made mistakes, creating a hostile environment in the firm disincentivizing middle managers to sell issues. This exacerbated the other contextual cue of relationship quality, given the perceived aggression from top management the relationship between the different levels could not be trusting nor friendly and resultantly gave middle managers no reason to say things that the top would not want to hear. This would not lead to imminent problems, as seen by Nokia’s continued growth during this period, although it did lead to a sense of conformity overtime disallowing middle managers to have a positive impact on Nokia’s strategic decision making.<nl><nl>The theory of Issue-selling intention clearly defines that it should be top management facilitating an ease of communication and instigating a sense of security with bringing forward problems present in the firm. The key underlying issue was the oppressive and domineering culture present at Nokia which created a chasm between top and middle level management. Given that this culture had been present for more than a decade top management should have taken action, slowly opening more channels of communication between the middle and top levels while assuring support for those that did come forward.<nl><nl><question3><nl><nl>To anyone working for Nokia it was clear that what top management said could not be refuted, being critical was not a part of the corporate culture and there were fierce repercussions threatened for those that spoke out of line. Within this context, middle managers needed to thread the needle and influence strategic direction in a way that wouldn’t cause friction with top management. One of these ways could have been issue bundling, where the middle managers would try to tie their issues with already agreed-upon goals so as to highlight the importance of their issue to top management in a way that could not be overlooked (Dutton et al., 2001). Middle management could for example try tying their issues to valued goals such as profitability and in this way increase the likelihood of having their issue addressed. This would have been a potent way for middle managers to get senior management to take action on issues that were very evident but not brought up for fear of being reprimanded.<nl><nl>In addition to this bundling of issues, another way in which middle level management could influence strategy and implement change would be through the collaboration and wider involvement of employees in selling the issues. Communication did not flow upwards within Nokia, but it did flow horizontally within those at the same level and middle level managers discussed openly the choices they made and reports they gave top management. As a result of collaboration with likeminded individuals, the middle managers would be able to win internal allies and accumulate internal influence (Wickert, C. et al., 2018). In turn managers would feel more empowered and confident to critique the top management’s instructions, which overtime would change the corporate culture and create a more open dialogue within the business. Therefore, middle level managers could have brought their issues to the top easier if they turned to each other for support as they knew of the problems plaguing the business but were too intimidated to bring them forward.<nl><nl>On the contrary, whatever change to come about would take time to implement, as shown on the theory of ‘The transition curve’. The first two phases of this theory capture the difficulty of individuals letting go of the past and coming to terms with the need for change (Balogun et al., 2016). As depicted on the theory, it would take a lot of courage to go against the corporate culture and begin to criticise top management knowing the risks that this would entail and would then lead to lower self-confidence of the managers. A caveat however would be that this theory solely focuses on the individual, and forgets the effect of the collective, which in this case would be great given the change undertaken to influence strategy would be done by all the middle managers, cohesively.<nl><nl><question4><nl><nl>The Nokia case study illustrates the rise and fall of a global market leader and highlights the difficulties of maintaining success in the face of an ever-changing external environment. Firms need to be able to move with the times so as to not be left behind. If there are parts of the firm, especially core competencies, that aren’t working as well as they once did then the firm needs to put it behind them and move on. Incumbents are often ‘overthrown’ when they cannot recognise the threat posed by disruptive innovation and instead continue with the converse of sustaining innovation (Schmidt, G.M., 2008). This was most certainly the case with Nokia, it had invested so much in its own software Symbian that there could be no doubts about its longevity and top management continually asked to incrementally update and change it. This was a key mistake, however, as not only was the software old fashioned as compared to the newer and improved IOS systems, but it was also very difficult to work with. The fact that Nokia tried to force Symbian to work for so long is in part what led it to its eventual demise. Instead, the firm should have cut out Symbian as soon as it stopped producing results and moved on with radical OS innovation that the firm so sorely needed in order to face the increasing competition. This in turn would have reduced pressure on the software organisation and given them the time necessary to produce a quality product instead of rushing results just to meet deadlines.<nl><nl>Overtime this lack of transformational change will cause a business to become less and less in touch with the ever-changing demands of consumers. The phenomenon of Strategic Drift will resultantly occur when a firm becomes less in line with the environment within which the organization operates (Johnson, G., 1992), this was the case with Nokia and can lead to a firms eventual demise. Incumbent firms use incremental change, continuing with the practices that have made them so successful in the past, until the reach a flux. At this point managers are unsure of what to do as they have fallen so far behind market trends and resultantly if they do not start transformational change then they may die. This theory can be useful for incumbent firms to recognise the faults that they can make but should be wary that the theory is not as simple as it seems. As in the Nokia case, it took a few years before the firm really started seeing the negative results from not adapting to the times and as a result the theory may be seen as too simplistic in truly addressing the heart of the issue.<nl><nl>A final key point that incumbent firms could learn from Nokia is that they cannot become arrogant and must keep managers humble so as to mitigate the overestimation of one’s capabilities. There was a lack of concern from the top, consistent within the middle levels of management that the iPhone was no threat to them. This sentiment arose from the feelings that the firm was invincible due to its market leadership and R&amp;D strength where it had invested over $50 billion over two decades. The overzealousness of the managers would lead to an incorrect assessment of the threat of competition, and lead to an eventual decline of the firm. Incumbent firms should take this example and remain sober minded with regards to competition and learn from Nokia the effects that disruptive innovation can have.", "<addr15_FN>,<nl><nl>Thank you for your email.<nl><nl>Unfortunately I do not have access to a computer and my internet access is quite limited.

{"id": "7de55ac3-7731-4524-99da-823e08d72768", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Abstract <nl>59 undergraduate psychology students replicated the Stroop test (Stroop, 1935) by identifying the colour of the font of 60 stimulus words in two conditions: congruent, where the ink colour is consistent with the word itself, and incongruent, where the ink colour is different to the word itself. The results showed that the reaction time for the incongruent condition was longer than the congruent condition. This can be supported by the selective attention theory, which states that it requires more attention to name the ink colours than to read the words (Johnston and Dark, 1986). The future implications of the Stroop test and results of the study involve the ability to identify certain brain regions (MacLeod, 2015). <nl>Introduction<nl>The Stroop Test, introduced by Stroop (1935), is a neuropsychological test which assesses the ability to suppress cognitive interference when the processing of one stimulus slows down the processing of a second stimulus (Scarpina and Tagini, 2017). In Stroop’s first experiment, he used five words and their matching ink colours, and participants were instructed to read each word aloud as fast as possible. In experiment 2, participants had to read the ink colours aloud rather than the word itself. The experimental condition was incongruent as the word was not the same as the colour of the ink. Participants had a longer reaction time when they were instructed to name the ink colour of the incongruent words compared to the congruent words in the control condition (MacLeod, 1991). <nl>This effect can be explained by the selective attention theory, as naming the ink colours required more attention than reading the words, hence these simultaneous stimuli were processed differently (Johnston and Dark, 1986). The interference Stroop effect demonstrated further led to the development of the Stroop Test. Literature suggests that this is a consistent effect, with results of the Stroop test having high reliability (Siegrist, 1995). This gives rise to the hypothesis that the reaction time for the incongruent condition, where the words and font colour are different, will be longer than the congruent condition.<nl>Method<nl>Participants:<nl>59 undergraduate psychology students from their first year at Aston University were recruited for this experiment via opportunity sampling.<nl><nl>Design:<nl>The design was repeated measures and the independent variable was the congruency of the font colour and the meaning of the word itself, with two levels being congruent and incongruent. The dependent variable was the reaction time (in milliseconds) for participants to name the font colour in each condition.<nl><nl>Materials:<nl>PsychoPy was used to implement the design of the experiment and collect reaction time data. The stimulus words for the congruent condition were ‘red’ in a red font, ‘green’ in a green font, and ‘blue’ in a blue font. The stimulus words for the incongruent condition were ‘red’ in a green font, ‘green’ in a blue font, and ‘blue’ in a red font. The response options available were the left arrow for red, the up arrow for green, and the right arrow for blue. <nl><nl>Procedure:<nl>Participants gave informed consent prior to conducting the experiment. They were instructed to identify the colour of the font the word was printed in, by pressing the corresponding responses on the keyboard. The stimuli were presented in a randomised and counterbalanced order. Participants saw the 6 stimulus types 10 times, with 60 trials in total. They then identified the colour of the font of the words by pressing the keyboard as fast as possible, with the keyboard response signalling the next trial. The reaction times for each trial were stored and saved for further analysis.<nl><nl>Results<nl>Table 1.<nl><table><nl><nl>As the hypothesis suggested, the mean for the incongruent condition is higher than the congruent condition (Table 1). The low standard deviations show that results did not vary highly in both conditions, suggesting that results may be consistent within each condition. <nl>A Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed that there was a statistically significant difference in reaction times between incongruent and congruent conditions at a 95% confidence level (Z= -3.638, p= .001). <nl><nl>Discussion<nl>The research hypothesis was supported as the reaction time for the incongruent condition was significantly longer than that of the congruent condition, which was consistent with previous research by Stroop (1935).<nl>A limitation of the study was the small sample size and type of participants tested, as the results from only 59 undergraduate psychology students fail to produce an accurate representation of the general population. This is shown by Hackshaw (2008), explaining that small sample sizes produce results which overestimate the magnitude of the difference. To improve this, a wider sample size extending outside of the university would be required to assess whether the results are truly reliable. Additionally, the risk of demand characteristics due to the Stroop test being well-known may mean that participants would deliberately take a longer time to identify the colour of the font in the incongruent condition compared to the congruent condition. Research participants are likely to hypothesise an aim of the study when they are aware that they are being observed (Hogg and Cooper, 2007). This could be remedied by introducing a pilot study where participants are asked about their perception of the aim of the study upon completion, allowing for the adaptation of the instructions and presentation of stimuli according to their responses. <nl>Future implications of the Stroop test include its ability in testing the function of associated brain regions (MacLeod, 2015), and the understanding of cognitive interference. This therefore allows for further research on brain regions related to the Stroop test, assisting in treatment and recovery of individuals with brain damage in these areas. Future research testing various groups of people, such as cognitively impaired, could provide useful when investigating which brain regions affect reaction times in the incongruent condition, demonstrating the full extent of the effect of the Stroop test.", " the link to the survey does not appear to be working.<nl><nl>Thanks<new>Hi,<nl><nl>Yes I managed to submit the report on time.<nl><nl>Thanks,<new>Hi <addr4_FN>,<nl><nl>No worries at all.

{"id": "d2d43037-ccf3-41d8-86b9-495b9b141a7a", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Expression of emotion is one of the key ways in which humans communicate with one another and this expression is executed in many ways through tone of voice, body language (Medjden et al., 2020), the language we speak (Sun et al., 2020) and most importantly, our facial expressions. To effectively communicate with facial expressions, humans need to be able to correctly recognise these emotions and respond appropriately. Here, the question of what constitutes correct recognition of facial displays of emotion arises. This is achieved when the perceiver recognises the emotion intended by the person expressing the emotion. Thus, according to this definition, correct recognition of emotion is very subjective, proving that recognition of facial displays of emotion is a non-universal process. There are many factors that determine the non-universality of this phenomenon, but for this essay, only three factors will be discussed: 1) culture (Widen et al., 2011), 2) gender (Spies and Sevincer, 2018), and 3) mental illness (Uljaravic and Hamilton, 2013). This essay reviews the literature surrounding these factors and aims to support the argument of correct recognition of facial displays of emotion being non-universal with a wide range of convergent evidence.<nl><nl>The main factor to consider when arguing that recognition of facial displays is not universal is the role of culture. There has been vast amount of research that proves that culture does indeed influence emotion recognition. For example, studies by Widen et al (2011) found that culture influences the recognition of the basic emotions (Ekman and Friesen 1976). They conducted two studies: the first one involved 88 university students from Boston college rating 10 different facial expressions – first with a free label format and then with a forced-choice format. The second study employed the exact same method, but they increased the list of choices in the forced-choice task to include the three most commonly mentioned states (confused, thinking, suspicious) and a \"none of the above\" option. They found that although there was moderate agreement on the predicted emotion when assessed with forced choice (study 1: 58%; study 2: 42%), there was significantly low agreement when participants were assessed with free labelling (study 1: 18%; study 2: 16%). Therefore, this contrast in agreement in the different conditions possibly suggest that the options presented in a forced choice task may influence and shape their answer, meaning it is not the ideal task type to use when conducting emotion recognition research. Moreover, free labelling tasks have more ecological validity, making them more valid than forced choice tasks. <nl><nl>However, as with any psychological research, this study has limitations. While the researchers made sure to include individuals from various backgrounds in their sample size, the main drawback is that all of the participants had some exposure to Western, US culture as they were all university students at an American university. This means that even participants who maybe were not US citizens, still had been exposed to Western culture to an extent which may have influenced their answers and thus, the data of the culturally diverse participants would not be as accurate as if they had never moved to the US. Therefore, it is important to consider research that has employed participants from non-Western backgrounds. <nl><nl>Neuroimaging research conducted by Harada et al (2020) shows emotion recognition is influenced by culture by showing that neural activity in certain brain areas was different among participants from different ethnic backgrounds and that in-group biases influenced this activity. The study involved 3 groups of participants; native Japanese (JP) individuals who lived in Japan, Caucasian Americans (CA) and Japanese Americans (JA) both of which lived in the US. The study involved an fMRI scan of the participants while they completed an emotional face and perceptual matching task, viewing stimuli of either Japanese or Caucasian faces depicting negative emotions (fear or anger) or simple shapes that served as control. The results of this study show that in-group biases and collectivistic values influence cultural modulation of neural response in the bilateral amygdala. Furthermore, bi-cultural JAs showed enhanced neural responses in the ventral medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices during the perception of Japanese negative facial expression which suggests greater sensitivity to ingroup biases in individuals from more than one culture. Thus, this study is a prime example of how culture can shape emotion recognition – if this was a universal phenomenon, then all participants would have had the same level of neural activity in the amygdala however that was not the case. Furthermore, the researchers also made sure to select participants from collectivist cultures – those who had never been exposed to individualistic cultures – which make the data more reliable as it is less likely to be influenced by Western norms. As culture plays a significant role in influencing emotion recognition of facial displays of emotion, credibility to the belief that emotion recognition is non-universal is given.<nl><nl>Another factor to consider when discussing whether correct recognition of facial displays of emotion is a universal process is the role of gender. Research has shown that gender influences emotion perception and recognition among humans. Indeed, a study conducted by Spies and Sevincer (2018) showed that women were much better than men at recognising whether smiles were genuine or not. They used a behavioural experimental paradigm whereby they had participants judge single and adjacent photos. The single photos involved both authentic and unauthentic smiles and participants were required to indicate which smile they thought the photo showed. The adjacent photos involved photos of the same person depicting either an authentic smile or an unauthentic smile. The results showed that women outperformed men in differentiating the two types of smiles in the adjacent photos condition. This therefore suggests that gender does play a role in recognition of facial displays of emotion. <nl><nl>However, it is important to note that this study only explores gender influence in this area in only one type of experimental paradigm – a forced choice test. An issue with this type of test is that it lacks ecological validity as in real life, people differentiate facial displays of emotion through various means for example, via their eyes. Indeed, a study by Hall et al (2009), using eye tracking techniques, found that women were quicker and more accurate in recognising expressions than men and they looked more at the eyes of the person in the photo stimuli than men. Thus, this study shows that by even using a different experimental technique (other than a forced choice task) gender differences in recognition of facial displays of emotion are still evident. <nl><nl>Mental illnesses also have proven to be an influencing factor in the correct recognition of facial displays of emotion. In a meta-analysis study by Uljarevic and Hamilton (2013), it was found that autistic individuals found it difficult to recognise facial displays of emotion. The systematic review involved 48 papers that all employed a behavioural study paradigm, that is, participants in the study were required to do a type of behavioural task. The results of this meta-analysis found a large negative effect size that suggests the autistic individuals have a general impairment in emotion recognition. <nl><nl>However, it is too presumptive to claim that the findings of this meta-analysis are applicable to other research investigating the role of mental illnesses on recognition of emotions using different experimental paradigms, i.e. those that deal with neuro-psychological data that is obtained through neuro-imaging techniques or other physiological methods. As highlighted before, the above study looked at studies that employed behavioural tasks. It is important to establish whether the findings of that study would still be prevalent when alternative techniques are used. <nl><nl>In support of this, a meta-analysis study conducted by Cuve et al (2018) found similar results to the previous study, but their analysis included physiological and eye-tracking studies. This study involved a review of 21 studies and the results showed that the majority of the studies suggested that individuals with autism show a level of active or reflexive avoidance to the eyes, consequently missing the subtle social cues conveyed through this particular body part. The eyes are a crucial part of the body in that they play a significant role in processing emotional expressions, especially negatives ones such as fear and sadness (Scheller et al 2012). <nl><nl>Therefore, in line with the previous meta-analytic study discussed in this essay, the findings of this study also suggest that individuals with autism struggle recognising facial displays of emotion, especially negative emotion. Thus, with research that strongly supports the notion that mental illnesses play a role in influencing recognition of facial displays of behaviour, the notion that this phenomenon is not universal but rather dependent on many factors is proven to be more credible.<nl><nl>Overall, the non-universality of correct recognition of facial displays of emotion is widely researched. The factors discussed in this essay all influence emotion recognition of facial displays in distinct ways; it seems individuals from different cultures perceive facial emotions differently, women, more than men, are more likely to correctly recognise facial displays of emotion and autistic individuals generally have a difficulty in distinguishing and thus recognising different emotions. It also important to note that while emotion recognition of faces can involve either positive or negative emotions, it is more often the case that these factors play a bigger role when individuals are required to distinguish between negative faces rather than positive ones. That is, non-universality of correct recognition of facial displays of emotion is more evident in negative emotions than positive ones.", "<addr6_FN>,<nl><nl>Thank you so much for your help.<nl><nl><nl>Best wishes,<nl><part_FN><new>yo,<nl><nl>This is the powerpoint currently. viola!<nl><nl>-<part_IN><new>Hi <addr3_FN>,<nl><nl>I have attempted to do all the analyses the way you showed me, but I am unsure if I have done it right.

My argument in this essay is that both these processes have a pivotal role to play in facilitating and hindering societal growth. Regardless of these, we should work to fortify this institution as both factors are necessary for the growth of our democracy and this institution has a fundamental role to play in protecting the interests of all citizens as well as promoting equality. <nl>The power of media has been constantly viewed in terms of the ability of a single individual or group to enforce order and command authority over a vast number, enabling the entity to hold power over something like a media environment with ease (Freedman a 2014, pp.11). This resulted in weakening the public domain via undermining the autonomy and wide range of diversity that is necessary for democracy to take place effectively. As an example, take Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, who has an immense amount of power, control and influence, some might even say that it is unprecedented. The most troublesome element of Facebook is Zuckerberg’s ability to manipulate and influence the data of two billion people (Hughes, 2019, pp.7). <nl>Over the years, Zuckerberg has accumulated a few companies such as Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. The sheer amount of unparalleled control and influence that a single individual has is staggering. In addition, this immense level of power that Zuckerberg has at his disposal is unwanted and undemocratic. The reasoning being that such an extensive amount of power, no matter how good the intentions, does instigate corruption. There is the constant risk of using this kind of concentrated power, especially when left unchecked, for personal use and this, in turn, is dangerous (Freedman b 2014, pp.319-334). To put it into perspective Facebook uses the medium of media to get people to use its products. Then, they use the response of that individual to manufacture more data, making Facebook’s ability to calculate what you will do in a situation pervasive and a threat to democracy. (Zuboff 2018, pp. 287-289). <nl>Furthermore, another detrimental effect of democracy is that it risks the wrong choice of public servant. In this regard, the election of Donald Trump is an apt example. As Facebook has one of the most advanced predictive systems in the world, Trump was able to use this to his advantage by using the analytic data collected by Facebook. There were able to connect the files of voters to individual behaviour and then show specific ads that correlated with their voting patterns. Since winning the election Trump’s bizarre behaviour combined with his delusional ideas continually reinforces the fact that he is not fit to rule America and the main aid here was Facebook, which propelled the success of his election undermining the government (Bump 2018, p.1-2). <nl>Another factor is not adequately allowing individuals the right to vote. The devastating impact, which media has on our democracy is still present. Individuals can vote for individuals based on certain factors, such as how their ideology matches with the running candidate or something as <nl>fickle as admiring the appearance of the candidate. This can lead to bias where an individual is more likely to pick a candidate if their beliefs are aligned with theirs (Caselli, F 2007, pp1-3) These factors may not even have anything to do with how capable and well suited they are for the job. In the case of America, this worsened the fact that many states where Trump’s opposition received their votes were \"slave states\". There was an agreement made in the US constitution where every enslaved individual would only count as 35ths of a person (Acharya, A et al 2015, pp.4-7). This meant that even if more votes were obtained by other political candidates they would count as lesser votes overall, reducing their viability. <nl>In addition to this, there are profound issues when it comes to the topic of elite ownership and media power. Many individuals in the ruling class vigorously compete for power and ownership, which include the self-regulating ability to overcome democratic blocks (Marx 2010[1867] pp.8- 11). These individuals, known as the elite of society, often have a significant role to play in the media and the various ways that individuals, by certain messages, are susceptible to whatever the outlet portrays. They can use the controlling stakes they have in companies to get across a message that they want or control elements of news programs, newspapers and magazines all to the detriment of the working class and the surrounding institutions of society. Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffet and Rupert Murdoch to name a few individuals who have bought controlling shares in media outlets. Rupert Murdoch, it can be said that he simply has too much power over the British state. (Helm, T et al 2011, pp1). Between them, they own media companies such as the Washington post and the Wall Street Journal, only further emphasising how the elite can hinder democracy. <nl>A sizeable number of shares bought by an individual would leave a company’s rule to one individual, especially with social media companies (Mills, C.W 1959:3-27). In this case, the media is hindering democracy since it is allowing certain individuals to misuse and manipulate public resources. This is because considering the amount of power that individuals can obtain over public and private sectors, to the point where they can influence and predict whom you vote for via subliminal messaging or manipulating your data to benefit their agendas. They can even go the extent of using your data to predict with a high degree of accuracy the way you will behave and the resultant impact on democracy. For example, the analytic data that Facebook collected and how it assisted Trump’s election. The possibilities are innumerous as to how they can exert their power. As a result, unethical practices are perpetuated, and the consequence is even more power and control which leads to a vicious cycle whereby the elite act in favour of the action which will provide them with the most benefit. These processes cripple democracy and making it feel more like a bureaucracy. <nl>Alternatively, even though the media can hinder democracy, there are ways that the media can support it, even strengthening it. One of these ways is that it protects the interest of its members. Democracy is unique in the sense that it allows people to get personally involved within their government. One way to achieve this is through social media platforms. In this way, <nl>the public have a sense of autonomy and a voice to speak up for themselves as to how they would prefer the running of their country. The choice is solely theirs as to whom they would want to elect depending on a wide range of reasons. One reason could be they think about who could, in the best way, represent their interests as well as benefit the country. Thus, giving the people free rein to choose whatever they like which also means that they could choose to not vote at all if they so wish. Everyone’s opinions, through their votes, are included. This is regardless of them being in the majority or not, which appeases the public and makes them more amiable to the idea of democracy (Caplan 2007, pp.3-7) <nl>Moreover, promoting equality positively is significantly beneficial to democracy. Through using a democratic system, which connects relationally with media, a person is free to explore differentiating arguments of the running candidates, a party’s manifesto details and any other details they could ever want to know. The fairness of this process is further emphasised by the fact that, regardless of social or economic background, public opinion is given. Even if you are wealthy or poor, have a lavish or humble lifestyle, under democracy your rights to vote are equal. Media only enhances the available opportunities. As a result, giving the liberal opportunity to engage in a political process in which you feel inclined towards since in the pure sense of democracy there is no bias or favouritisms. <nl>The media, being the main means of mass communication, is an enabler for democracy as having more educated voters can lead to a more legitimate government. Due to this media encourages mass participation and extends the reach that democracy can have over a country. This is beneficial as the institutions surrounding society also get strengthened as a result of the positive and consistent messages being promoted (Parsons 1992[1951] pp.45-51).Additionally, as larger numbers involved within a democracy means that a fairer and more representative process can take place and having an unrestricted, educated and varied choice enhances this. Thus, as individuals can make an informed decision how they want to engage in democratic practices, there is a higher degree of transparency within the government and that encourages more trust and in turn, makes democracy as fair and just of a system as possible (Katona, 2015 pp.359-394) <nl>For example, during elections there are several messages given about institutions, using the medium of media, such as education and health care. These include ideas such as improving the levels of education by developing a better curriculum and allocating more resources to ensure that students have a better overall quality of learning. Also, regarding the health care system the promise of more nurses, to improve the quality of service. Via this method, individuals engage within their political environment more if they know they are going to benefit as a result. So, as the surrounding institutions that underpin society strengthen, society becomes more stable. These institutions work synergistically building momentum of one another to <nl>reach a common social goal, stability (Canon, W.B 1987, pp.170-176). Thus, making it unavoidable for democracy to improve as well. <nl>Within a country, the group with the power to govern a country and its business is the government. This entity uses the tool of media to aid them in bettering the quality of democracy for everyone and strive to withhold the principles that their position stands for, which include the responsibilities they have to their nation. To hinder the monopoly of authorities, democracy needs to flourish. The state assists with this as the elected leaders are only in power for a certain period, so it is in their best interest to enforce the successful delivery of their promised policies, which benefit the people as well as their tenure but only if they are willing to do so. They are varied ways and methods in which they monopolise authority, a few of these being price capping and quality regulation (Bourdieu 1991[1982 pp.242-245]).Without the latter businesses would continuously put prices higher at a competitive rate leading to a decline in consumer welfare as well as lead to inefficiency. With the former, they can check the provision of good quality service as leaving businesses to their own devices will result in reluctance to keep the standards high. All this resulting in more stable democratic institutions. <nl>Nonetheless, government institutions, like any other institutions, are susceptible to exploitation as the elected use their position to support their own agenda, often using illegitimate means to get ahead. Furthermore, a beneficial point for media supporting democracy is that the structure of democracy works to reduce exploitation by spreading out the power that the role gives through bodies or committees who oversee the individual making sure no one has overarching power over the system. It is the fact that this task allows for easy power distribution, giving an equal opportunity for all (Gündemir, S. et al. 2017, pp.34-41). <nl>Within the government, the component of freedom usually allows individuals to act however, they want so long it is not at the detriment of others. Inside the structure of democracy, the population is free to act in any way they desire to seek any result. However, legal barriers restrict them, as they cannot go out of their way to harm another without repercussions. This governing structure grants the opportunity to pursue different careers and opportunities as well as giving a genuine voice to the people. Media is the thing that encourages such diversity, as you are free to express your own opinion and determine many lifestyle choices. <nl>Neither the communication tool, known as the media, is all-knowing nor is it useless. This tool can be capable of a vast amount such as altering the state and nature of dynamic relations within society for the better alongside mistaking acts and events creating a strain within society (Corner, 2011, pp.27-30). (For example) Due to the reasons mentioned, media can be a force for progressive change as well as a hindrance. It is safe to say that the media has a pivotal part to play within society, serving a variety of functions, and has multiple uses. Previously, having seen that the media can help the development of democracy, via methods such as promoting equality and the interest as citizens, individual trust within this process increases. Moreover, knowing that the media has the capacity to obstruct democracy. I am going to propose the argument that the media can neither endanger nor support democracy because it does not <nl>hold any power in and of itself. This communication outlet is merely the space in which power resides (Castells, 2009, pp.193). <nl>Therefore, media is not the chief proponent but merely hosts the interplay of power, control and dominance. It opens a vast space where people can come and hold power in areas such as business and politics (Freedman a, 2014, pp.11). Communication networks are central to this process and are key sources in society for it to hold power. The media agents involved help to spread this diverse message and engage in this with the end goal of altering the nature of the state (Castells, 2009, pp. 302-3). <nl>The problem has never been determining media’s influence with assisting or deteriorating the economic situation, it is more to do with who occupies and aggregates the larger sources of information and the amount of space they take within this network. Media’s main strength comes from the intertwining of various communication networks such as business, finance etc. Media weakens by the absence of news existing in some form or another within this domain. If there is nothing to occupy the space, then the impact of media is lackluster (Castells,2009, pp.194-195). Media cannot hold power over individuals of its own accord, it requires the strategic implementation of information from a combination of areas compiled into one place which then goes on to infiltrate all elements of social life. <nl>Conclusively, the relationship between media and democracy is extensive and far-reaching. Power, being ubiquitous in nature, seeps into the depths of media outlets and political institutions such as democracy. The power of media transcends merely control and is something far more perplexing. Even though we can see ways that media can assist and hinder democracy, its actual role is far greater and bewildering. I propose that more research is needed into the true nature of media and the way that its role functionally relates to different institutions, as well as the devastating impact it can have on society. <nl>", "u want it’s not like I’m gonna look at it ☺️😂<new><addr_FN> when u need something I’m ur twin 🤨😂🤣<new>Wth my head hurts just looking at tht list 😂😂🤦‍♂️<new>And there’s still more 😂😂<new>😭😭🤕<new><addr_FN> I’m not ur slave<new><addr_FN> interesting paan going on there 😂<new>Says who.

It is Â£116 per night. The hotel does come with a cafe, restaurant and souvenir shop but should you need to explore the city's locations-Fresh stop is a must go to cafe in the city centre. For a restaurant, where you can have Sauteed Reinderrs, restaurant Kuu which is in the city centre. The souvenir shop is called Finnska souvenirs and that in the town as well. Also, the Helskini city museum is a must to learn about the city's heritage and history. Next, there are several popular places to listen to live music.

{"id": "697c6c20-f2bf-4b8f-9542-f3bcf0ad821a", "discourse_types": ["essay", "text_message"], "pair": ["In this essay, I will mention the key features of the psychodynamic approach, such as Freud and the unconscious mental processes, and those of the biological approach – genetics, heredity and evolution. Core assumptions, such as the role of nature and nurture in the key features, will also be remarked upon and compared. This essay will allude to how these perspectives are different, their stands on the nature-nurture debate, and how they are similar – such as the influence of childhood.<nl><nl>The key features of the psychodynamic approach are mostly synonymous to Sigmund Freud, and his research with unconscious mental processes. This approach focuses on the influence of the ‘unconscious’ and how our behaviour as adults is rooted from childhood experiences (Jarvis, 2000). Freud derived theories about the mind and personalities, coming up with theory about the conscious, preconscious and unconscious, how Freudian slips showed what you are truly thinking but trying to hide, and the It (Id), I (Ego), and above-I (superego) (Freud, 1993 as cited in Jarvis, 2000). This means that this approach looks at how past experiences are reflected in current behaviour.<nl><nl>Like the psychodynamic approach, the biological approach has a researcher well known to the field – Charles Darwin. The key features of this approach focus on the role of genetics and evolution. Evolution refers to the way genes in our DNA can change over generations due to the role of ‘natural selection’. Twin studies have been helpful in researchers understanding to the extent genes play a role in behaviour and how much the environment may play a role in this also. For example, twin and adoption studies show how the risk of developing schizophrenia is higher if you are genetically similar than dissimilar (environment also plays a role as concordance is not 100%) - Cardno &amp; Gottesman (2000). This means that this approach focuses on the interaction of genes and the environment - how nature can influence nurture and nurture can influence nature.<nl><nl>A difference between these approaches, is the way that these perspectives view the influence of nature and nurture. The psychodynamic approach concentrates on the role of the unconscious and childhood experiences being the influence on adult behaviour. Therefore, psychoanalysts, such as Freud,, emphasise the role of nurture over nature. In contrast, the biological approach concentrates on the way nature and nurture have a similar influence on each other – the role of genetics as well as environmental influences. <nl><nl>Another similarity with the approaches is that they both have socially sensitive research that have impacted on people negatively. According to Jarvis (2000), in the 1950s and 1960s, psychiatrists following psychodynamic concepts blamed autism on poor parenting. Tavris and Wade (1997) [as cited in Jarvis (2000)] described a case study that illustrated the negatives of taking a purely psychodynamic approach. This approach is reductionist. Its theories are derived from case studies such as Anna O and the work or Tavris and Wade and it tries to explain everything in accordance to psychodynamic theories. Reductionist approaches included socially sensitive research which as a result significantly harmed people – like the eugenics movement.<nl><nl>The work of Galton, fixated on the role of genetics, influencing the eugenics movement. His focus on certain traits being better in society and the fixation that these traits are hereditary only led to the research being abused and hurting thousands of people (Fairholm, 2011). Eugenics was very popular to begin with but eventually it led to a way to discriminate, segregate and sterilise (,and in Nazi Germany, systematically murder) millions of people deemed to have undesirable genes. This dark side of psychology was reductionist and ethically immoral. The eugenics movement attempted to use just genes to explain everything about people. As a result, by focusing only on genes and inheritance, the importance of the environment was ignored (Fairholm, 2011). <nl><nl>Neurodevelopmental disorders show that genes are not the only factor to developing a disorder, for example, while Fragile X Syndrome is a purely genetic disorder, Down Syndrome and Williams Syndrome are not hereditary (passed from parents to offspring) even though its genetic, and Foetal Alcohol Syndrome is purely environmental – no genetic origin. (Witton, C., 2019). This means that separating genes and the environment is not appropriate as neurodevelopmental disorders here show that nature has influence over nurture (Fragile X Syndrome) and nurture has influence over nature (Foetal Alcohol Syndrome).<nl><nl>The understanding developed from biological theories and discoveries has aided in pharmacological treatment for psychological disorders and the potential understanding on how these disorders develop. The discovery of neurones (by von Waldeyer-Hartz) and eventual discovery of the Synapse (by Sir Charles Sherrington) led to the unearthing of neurotransmitters and their functions – and their influence on the brain and psychological disorders such as serotonin with depression. This has led to biopsychology to be considered scientific due to objective and controlled research.<nl><nl>Similar to this, Freudian theory on ego defences such as displacement, denial and projection are considered today in psychodynamic therapy. These are considered in therapy as psychiatrists, and other mental health professionals, see psychological problems as rooted in childhood and dealing with the root cause, and gaining insight into trauma, can help relieve symptoms. An example of this used in the past would be the case study of Anna O – bringing trauma into the consciousness by talking about it resolved the symptoms of her hysteria. However, this approach includes vague untestable concepts that lack specifics required to assist in Psychology being considered a science. For example, the Oedipus Complex is almost impossible to measure and the use of case studies, such as Anna O reduces the validity of this approach and it being scientific as participants are not typical of the population. (Jarvis, 2000)<nl><nl>Anna O is a case study in the psychodynamic approach which focused on how the mind served to adapt the individual to the environment. The mind presents hysteria to unresolved trauma, the mind adapting the individual to its environment and past experiences. Based on this, I suggest that psychodynamic approach has functionalist perspectives. However, with Freud’s insistence of interpreting and analysing dreams, this approach has certain structuralist qualities. The psychodynamic philosophy analyses the mind based on behaviour that presents itself, such as Freudian slips and dreams, which is partially what structuralism is based upon. Therefore, the psychodynamic approach is an interaction of functionalism and structuralism with a lean towards functionalism.<nl><nl>Similarly, the biological approach can be viewed to be an interaction of structuralism and functionalism. The approach analyses the mind and localises areas for specific jobs, such as with genetics and chromosome x or y on the last pair which determines gender or Broca’s area for speech aphasia. This is structuralist. Where this approach links with functionalism is through evolution. Where the mind has adapted an individual to their environment. This is evident with evolutionary fears – such as fear of heights, the dark and snakes. This behaviour increased survival in the past. Another example of this is the cuteness of babies. This is also a survival factor as infants are unable to look after themselves. As a result, this ‘cuteness’ factor elicits a caregiving response and the need to look after infants and protect them from the dangers. (Kringelbach, Stark, Alexander, Bornstein &amp; Stein, 2016).<nl><nl>A similarity between the biological and psychodynamic approach are that both are deterministic approaches rather than demonstrating free will in their theories. While the biological approach approaches the nature and nurture debate as it being an interaction between the two, it is largely a deterministic approach rather than free will. Biological determinism is where biological concepts or processes determine our thoughts and behaviours (Fairholm, 2011). This approach rejects a total genetic viewpoint, especially because of the eugenics movements, but elements of this approach is still deterministic. An example would be the argument for the MAOA gene and aggression. Some have argued in the past that because one may have this gene and commit and act of aggression, this excuses their behaviour. However, this cannot be accepted in the current Criminal Justice system and that people must take responsibility for their actions as other people with this gene can control their aggression (Holmgren &amp; Winterdyk, 2011). This example shows that the biological approach focuses on deterministic theories rather than free will.<nl><nl>Moreover, the psychodynamic approach leans more on determinism than free will. This is evident in the fact that Freudian concepts argue that behaviour in the current is influenced by past experiences in childhood. This leaves little room for free will as a result. Another example is through the ego defences suggested by Freud. These are considered an automatic phenomenon to protect a person from their trauma, for example repression of trauma or displacing anger from the object of their anger to someone more vulnerable – the person isn’t aware they are doing this consciously. Therefore, this removes the aspect of free will.<nl><nl>At first glance, one would assume that the biological approach and the psychodynamic approach are different, that because one focuses on genetics and evolution and the other focuses on early childhood experiences and the unconscious, that there are no similarities. However, this essay shows that, aside from the basic key features, the perspectives are more similar than first assumed. They have people that are well known to their areas – Freud and Darwin. Furthermore, both indicate that childhood has influence over behaviour – the unconscious desire and fears presented in Freudian theory and environmental influences on typical body development (Foetal Alcohol Syndrome). There are differences in the perspectives, such as the psychanalytical approach considering nurture to have more influence but the biological  approach considering the interaction of nature and nurture having equal amount of effect on behaviour. In conclusion, the biological and psychodynamic are much more similar than what would first be assumed.", "nting down?? x<new>Is it good?<new>I need to watch episode 3 first xx<new>😂😂 I'm assuming it's really good xx<new>You on the train now?<new>Is it direct <station1> to <station2>?

I have found a 4-star hotel situated 0.4 miles away from the city centre. For two nights it will cost £216. It is also situated close to the Seurasaraselka waters so, if we book a room with a view you will always get to see the water. This is £16 over budget but it was the best option in regards to tourist reviews and location. Caferino Obas is a cafe, which is only a ten-minute walk away from the hotel and they offer a great breakfast menu. They offer a wide range of options and alternatives for those who are allergic to Seafood. Helsinki Museum is a twenty-minute walk from the hotel but it is specifically a museum popular with tourists for being able to \"uphold Helsinki's heritage\". Therefore you will learn a lot about the city you are visiting. Finland's national dish is Sauteéd Reindeer. So I have found a very popular restaurant called Restaurant Lasipalatsi which offers this dish. They have a wide range of sides to go with this dish and before booking the restaurant we are able to call them up beforehand and warn them about your seafood allergy. Therefore the food will be catered for you specifically. There is a souvenir shop called Mikebon which offer a wide range of gifts. Especially toys which may be great for your children. Finally, for the evening I have found a Rock Music Club called Tavastia. Since you love live music I have found a club that offers Helsinki's popular genre and the club itself is quite old so this holds some heritage too. I hope you like the suggestions.

{"id": "bcf75dea-bef1-4f6d-a385-b92c0fc6e728", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["In this essay I will be making six points in order to assess the UK’s claims to be a ‘climate progressive’ state.<nl><nl>It is argued that the UK is a climate progressive state (Anderson, Broderick and Stoddard, 2020). The UK’s claim to climate leadership is strong and consistent particularly with the development of norms and actions. The UK has also been a key driver of EU climate policy particularly focusing on market approaches which has enabled the EU to meet its targets, as well as developed innovative policy mechanisms such as the Climate Change Act 2008 as well as agreeing to the Paris Agreement 2015. They have been an important supporter of ‘strong climate action both within the EU and in international climate negotiations’ (Dupont and Moore, 2019). Carter argues that between 2006 and 2010, climate change rose rapidly through the UK political agenda and ‘transitioned from low politics to high politics’ (Carter, Neil. 2014). British parties started to compete with one another to be the greenest which resulted in tremendous developments and progress in the 2000’s.<nl><nl>The norms underpinning UK climate policy involves, ambitious target setting, policy innovation and competitive focus on ‘clean growth’. In 2006, the Stern Review stressed that climate change will cause damage of ‘5-20% GDP per year if left unchecked’, however if action is taken immediately then only 1% per year would occur. It stresses that low carbon business opportunities should be followed and that the fight for climate change must be global and cooperative in order to work. This developed into a cost benefit argument, stressing that early mitigation of climate change is more cost effective rather than handling it in the future. The UK government therefore is looking at climate change from an economic point of view not as an ethical or moral viewpoint. Therefore, some may argue that the Stern Review acts as a double-edged sword, it points out the need to for action immediately, however its reasoning and the policy that was drawn after were driven for economic efficiency not the climate itself. The review resulted in a cost effective, market and technology orientated approach to climate change for the UK.<nl><nl>As a result of the findings from the Stern Review,  the UK government passed the Climate Change Act 2008 which allowed the UK to take a leading position in international climate as it was the first country to give a legally binding underpinning to its emissions reduction’s targets. The targets were to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 80% below the 1990 levels by 2050, however now the targets are ‘net zero’ by 2050. These targets are statutory and non–negotiable. This target made the UK a key leader and driver in climate change. These statutory targets are backed by 5 yearly carbon budgets and an independent Climate Change Committee and developed a low carbon transition plan. This policy was a great move for the UK, making it climate progressive by setting out ambitious targets supported by the law. The ambitious climate change policies set out by the UK ‘increases the competitiveness of the UK which encourages innovation and efficiency around the world’ (Bassi, 2016).<nl><nl>The UK has aggressively removed coal from the electricity generation mix, with April 2017 being the first day without coal in 135 years. They established a Powering Past Coal Alliance in 2017 which aimed to accelerate clean growth and to protect the climate through the rapid phase out of traditional coal power. The UK has also been able to generate low carbon electricity to a share of 52%. The UK also opened the world’s biggest offshore wind farms, using its geographical position as a benefit. As a result, offshore wind power is becoming almost as cheap as onshore wind and the most economically efficient way of generating electricity. This is another factor as why the UK could be argued as a climate progressive state.<nl><nl>However, as the policy developed by the UK were along the basis of economic efficiency and were developed in times of economic growth. Any changes to the economic status would threaten the policies and progressive moves the UK made and become an economic burden. During the economic crash, the Conservative Lib Dem coalition began to roll back on a number of key provisions of the CCA. As a result, the UK are not on track for meeting the legally binding 4th and 5th carbon budgets. They have failed on 14 out of 21 progress indicators which are identified by the Committee of Climate Change as of 2020. Important programmes have been cancelled in recent years, such as zero carbon homes. As a result, there are significant policy gaps between targets and action. Gillard argues the UK present themselves as leading the fight in climate change by setting ambitious targets ‘however, the gap between targets and implementation at the national level has been quietly growing’(Gillard, 2016). Therefore, some may argue that the UK has not been successful with their leadership on climate change.<nl><nl>Another issue that could be argued as to whether the UK is actually climate progressive is to understand what ‘net zero’ means. The CCA 2008 set out to have net zero GHG emissions by 2050. When net zero emissions are calculated, it does not take international aviation, imports, shipping or consumption into account. Therefore, the UK would still be emitting GHG emissions, however, have found ways to mitigate those emissions through things like carbon capture, storage and offsetting. Removing large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in order to compensate for the carbon that is being released now. This view on net zero emissions doesn’t really solve the problem. For one it is an indulgence, you are paying to excuse your own sins without changing your behaviour. Secondly, offsetting by planting trees to offset carbon for example, isn’t necessarily practical as it takes many years for that tree to grow and have an effect. This target also doesn’t explain what will happen after 2050 which could become an issue.<nl><nl>UK policy focuses on technological replacement for green growth, however it does not focus on changing norms of consumption or critiquing the idea of economic growth. The UK could be more progressive by attempting to educate and change social norms and perceptions on the way we live. Li and Pye argues that the UK has undergone a transition from export energy focused to market orientated. They argue that there are still lots of transitions required needed in the future (Li and Pye, 2018).<nl><nl>In conclusion, the UK can definitely be seen as a climate progressive state, they have made tremendous efforts in creating measures to limit change, through creating innovative policies which are strengthened by the law, being the first and only major country to do so. Being a key driver of EU climate policy and setting standards in policy for the rest of the world to follow. They will be hosting the Crucial Climate Change Conference in Glasgow 2021 which will give the UK the opportunity to demonstrate its leadership in climate change on the international stage. It could also be argued that the UK’s claims to being a progressive state are fragile and threatened as they are currently not being able to follow through or meet the deadlines set out in the CCA 2008.<nl><nl><nl>In this essay I will be making four points in order to assess the capacity of vegan food practices to provide a solution to the problem of climate change.<nl><nl>The idea of diets and climate change being linked has become a more mainstream idea over the recent years. Shove argues that the current ways of life and patterns of consumption are unsustainable. In order to have an effective response to climate change, new forms of living will have to take place across all of society (Shove, E. 2010). The human consumption of meat and dairy products is a major driver of climate change, with greenhouse gas emissions associated with their production accounting to over 14.5% of the global total (Bailey, Froggatt and Wellesley, 2014). Livestock production is the largest global source of methane and nitrous oxide and is also an important driver of deforestation which can be seen in the Amazon for example. Bailey et al argues that this is something that has to be addressed in public policy otherwise it will take all the space in carbon budgets especially as the world population increases and as the world population gets richer to ensure everyone has food to eat (Bailey, Froggatt and Wellesley, 2014).<nl><nl>Ruminant meat has a very large contribution to climate change of between 20 to 25 greenhouse gas emissions (g CO2 equivkcal) compared to plant-based products like wheat and rice which are extremely low (Clark and Tilman, 2017). Research shows that ruminant meat has ten to one hundred times the impact on climate change, land use, air and water pollution compared to plant-based products (Clark and Tilman, 2017). This therefore shows that a large reduction of the consumption and production of meat is needed in order to combat climate change.<nl><nl>The vegan society stated that the number of vegans in Great Britain quadrupled between 2014 and 2019 to 600,000 vegans, however, this is only 1.16% of the population. In order for vegan food practices to have an impact on climate change, a large amount of people would have to change their diets, which would be a rather difficult task. Sociological theories argues that what we eat and how we learn to eat is socially constructed, we learn an appetite or desire for specific goods which reflects our taste regimes. The construction of eating meat is socially normative and is seen as being pleasurable and hedonistic, which we learn and becomes an entitlement as a result of our status and social superiority. Piazza et al (2015) argues that people who eat meat argue it is ‘natural, normal, necessary and nice’. These are rationalizations people use to defend their choice of eating meat.<nl><nl>Similarly, the act of eating meat has attached itself to ideas of masculinity and femineity. Adams argues that manhood is constructed in western culture and society through access of meat eating and control of other bodies (Adams,C. 1995,2015).  Very often preparing certain forms of meat is associated with hegemonic forms of masculinity for example, barbeques. Whereas the production of food is generally dominated by women traditionally. Turner argues that masculinity is presented though what is consumed and in a patriarchal society whereas femininity is presented through what is not consumed (Turner, 2016). Eating meat is a widely established symbol of power, status and masculinity within today’s society. Men are more reluctant than women to endorse meat avoidance and reduced meat consumption out of fears of being seen less masculine. Therefore, in order for a large majority of people to change to a vegan diet, would not only require a change in perceptions of what a vegan diet has on your identity but also the diet would require a change in how society views masculinity.<nl><nl>Addressing veganism as a social practice requires attention to ways of doing things. You have to learn how to be vegan, how to prepare foods but also the importance that it would have on your identity.  Veganism is consciously practicing and is rule bound so those rules would have to be learnt and found throughout society. The mainstream social portrays of being vegan emphasises losing taste, eating bland food and not enjoying it. This portrayal would have to be challenged in order for more people to make a switch to a vegan diet. Recruitment to veganism requires learning, reflection and personal and collective identity work. It is not something that can just happen without any thought. Veganism isn’t just a diet – it’s an identity or even a resistant subculture. Therefore, relying on vegan food practices as a solution to the problem of climate change might be a rather optimistic viewpoint. Ivanova et al argue that ‘a large majority of the household carbon footprints can be mitigated with already available low-carbon consumption options’ and that through ‘challenging current patterns of consumption and societal dynamics through critical assessment of infrastructural, institutional and behavioural lock-ins needs to become a priority for successful climate change mitigation’ (Ivanova et al, 2020).<nl><nl>In conclusion, the capacity for vegan food practices to be a solution to the problem of climate change is large. If we are able to cut down the amount of meat products produced and consumed, it would have a large impact on climate change. However, there are several issues when it comes to trying to implement a vegan diet across society. The social norms around plant-based diets would have to change, societies view on masculinity being centred around meat eating would have to be challenged and the process of becoming vegan may have to become easier or more widely spoken about for example through education.

{"id": "5017622e-f53d-4b7d-8993-8c5f3a8d8369", "discourse_types": ["memo", "text_message"], "pair": ["Dear CEO, With regards to your upcoming conference in Helsinki from the 2nd to 4th September, I have researched and identified the relevant itinerary items for your trip. - I have identified two potential accommodations within the £200 per night budget: 1. Hotel U14 Autograph Collection (Unioninkatu 14) - this offers a room with an extra large double bed within a mile from the city centre and 0.8 miles of the beach for £308 (for both nights). This hotel looks very contemporary and also benefits from facilities including fitness centre and a restaurant. 2. Forenom Serviced Apartments (Kristianinkatu 11-13) - this offers a studio with two twin beds within a mile of the city centre and near the water also for £250 (for both nights). This option appears significantly more basic but would offer more independence as is self accommodating if that is what you wish for. - My research shows the Cafeteria Roastery (Runeberginkatu 31) to be the top rated breakfast cafe in the city centre so this would be my recommendation for breakfast. However, if staying at Hotel U14, there is an option to add breakfast for an extra £16 per night (totalling £342). - With regards to leisure activities for you to do in your free time during the trip, there is the Helsinki City Museum (Aleksanterinkatu 16) where you could get an insight into the history of the city, as well as the Apollo Live Club (Mannerheimintie 16) which has live music and comedic acts on Fridays and Saturdays. Both of which are reasonably priced and align with your interests. - There are countless restaurants in the city centre which would offer a variety of traditional cuisine (not involving sea food), though my recommendation would be Ravintola (Kasarmikatu 26) as this appears to offer a combination of fine dining with the traditional cuisine. - Finally there are a couple of large souvenir shops in the centre which would be perfect for you to get your children Finish souvenirs. My recommendations would be either Shop Helsinki-Mikebon (Simonkatu 9) or Kankurin Tapa (Phojoiseplanadi 35) which would be closer to your hotel. I am yet to book any of the above for your stay. If you could please review my recommendations and let me know if you think they are appropriate so that I can pass them onto the travel department to do the booking. Please let me know if you have any questions or would like any further recommendations or changes to your itinerary.", " are u ok?<new>Alright, thanks!<new>Umm I’ll probably get it on <day><new>What money is it btw?<new>Yeah I was worried that I wouldn’t get paid in time but I was<new>But I could still do with the money<new>Aw thanks<new>I guess I’ll pay you back on the <DDth><new>Very helpful thank you<new>Ohhh I’m not quite sure either<new>Details<new>The le<new>Pls<new>Sorry ur gonna have to wait till end of <month> ?<new>Joke hehe<new>Done<new>Wtf<new>Send it back then pls<new>£100 plus a new mascara<new>Thanks love means a lot<new>Do you even know what uni I go to<new>I would transfer next year but <university> doesn’t do my masters course"]}

{"id": "1cc8a1ec-a05f-482b-8d2e-b364dd60ef0f", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["The introduction to this essay will explain doping as a form of corruption and will cite statistics to convey the extent of its effect on sport. This will be accompanied by an examination of what the spirit of sport is. This essay's critical debate aims to expose WADA's ineffectiveness in ensuring that the spirit of sport triumphs over the doping corruption. In this regard, WADA's loose grip on national and sport’s governing bodies can be seen to disrupt clean athletes. The debate then will shift to how WADA's code is fundamentally discriminatory against athletes from developing countries, causing less privileged athletes to face harsher realities for the committing the same offences as their contestants. These problems are exacerbated by corruption in different countries where the punishments handed down by authorities do not reflect the crimes. The eventual finding is that WADA is unsuccessful because it lacks necessary authority. This essay will also offer a critique of the proposal of legalised doping, shedding light on its shortcomings. It will be concluded that an increase in WADA’s power is required for the spirit of sport. The conclusion is that WADA will only be able to promote the spirit of sport effectively when they are the final arbiter in enforcing the code. This essay includes insights from Sports science, medicine, sociology, ethics, psychology and economics to support its claims.<nl>Corruption is defined as ‘dishonest or illegal behaviour, especially of people in authority’. Gorse and Chadwick suggest corruption in sport includes illegal, immoral or non-ethical activities, which intentionally seek to distort the outcome of a sports competition for one or more parties' personal benefit. , Gorse and Chadwick analysed 2,089 cases of corruption in sports, where doping was present in 95.64% of cases.<nl>The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) is responsible for leading a collaborative worldwide movement for doping-free sport. They stress that anti-doping programmes foster the ‘spirit of sport’ which includes values like ethics, joy, education, health and fair play. According to the World Anti-Doping Code (WADC), doping is contrary to the spirit of sport, so impressions of sporting achievement are important. When an athlete achieves success, it is helpful that their performances are not overshadowed by scepticism. The Sport of cycling can be used as an example.<nl>Reeth and Lagae surveyed if doping was acceptable among different demographics in the cycling community. They reported a clear view that doping contradicts the spirit of fair play. When Chris Froome became the first Briton to win the Tour de France twice, his second victory was marred by doping allegations. Froome was eventually proven innocent, but there is no doubt that the distrust created by Lance Armstrong made public scepticism inescapable for anyone that proceeded him. From a sociological point of view, this proves that the social significance of any sport is heavily reliant on its winning athletes. These winners are currently expected to work honestly for their accomplishments. This might be done by training hard simply with a special talent. However, the vital spirit of sport is undermined if the organisation which regulates anti-doping is unsuccessful in doing so.<nl>It is very possible that chalking Armstrong’s wins did nothing to solve the problems he created. When he became the first cycling colossus, he grew to establish a legacy that would see his accomplishments rise in importance as the sport's history evolves and more athletes fail to better him. That became a double-edged sword when anti-doping campaigns erased these victories, thus profoundly undermining the sport's past and underlying spirit. A relentless scepticism of innocent winners could also turn athletes away from the sport, fearing the scrutiny their lives would face if they had any success. Surely any failure to solve this issue could damage the spirit of a sport and this failure can be traced back to WADA?<nl><nl>Clean athletes often lose out<nl>The WADC exists to maintain a fundamental right to compete in doping-free competition. This is why, if the WADC fails, any athlete who competes clean suffers the consequences. It is often the case that those who win are recalled, occasionally with a thought for second and third place, while those who finish below the podium positions sometimes fade into obscurity. These individuals forfeit the life-changing status and wealth that comes with success because they miss out on awards to dishonest athletes who dope. It is therefore important WADA ensures ‘clean athletes don’t suffer the devastation of stolen medal moments’. <nl>Unfortunately, many athletes have already been affected by this calamity. The Associated Press estimated that $410,000 could be owed to thousands of athletes because of only four track and field players who never returned their prize money from the Olympic Games after being caught doping.  Athletes are also sometimes given a cash sum by their country for placing well in a sporting event. Moreover, those that do not make it to the podium are deprived of recognition; Jo Pavey, who finished fourth in the 10,000m at the 2007 World Championships, was still waiting for her bronze medal nearly a decade later. <nl>When it comes to fixing these injustices, WADA loses out just as much. Appeals to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) can currently be made to recover an athlete’s losses, but the views of CAS rarely align with WADA’s recommendations. On top of that CAS also risks having its own decisions set aside by the Swiss Federal Court. The current format then receives criticism because many of its legal efforts have focused disproportionately on the suspected athlete’s right to fair process, meaning they fail to provide clean athletes with the attention they deserve. On the other hand, there are reasons why suspected athletes deserve reasonable legal process, such as mitigating factors. Goalkeeper Andre Onana was recently suspended for mistakenly taking a painkiller that turned out to be a banned substance. Although it is the athletes' duty to ensure that no banned substance enters their bodies, ignoring defendants entirely in favour of clean athletes does not seem like the most reasonable alternative. <nl>That being said, allowing implicated athletes from Russia to compete in the 2016 Olympics, did nothing to convey any consequences of doping on a national scale. When the IOC refused to follow any of WADA's guidelines on Russia it showed a blatant disregard for the spirit of sport and for the right to compete in doping-free sport. Likewise, the decisions of CAS have been criticised for being inconsistent and still allowing corrupt athletes to participate. Despite CAS’ shortcomings, it is nevertheless the responsibility of the WADC to provide guidance on these matters, but rules for state endorsed doping did not exist at the time. Critics have argued that not addressing that issue was ‘… the most detrimental aspect of the Code’.<nl>One might then argue WADA's inability to protect all athletes who participate clean does not imply that they are the sole culprit, since this would set an impossibly high standard for WADA. However, when the authors of the universal anti-doping rule do not agree with the enforcers, it creates a divide between the different anti-doping authorities to the detriment of any clean athlete. More recently it was reported that WADA has opened a formal investigation into UK Anti-Doping for enabling British Cycling to conduct its own investigation into one of its riders. This supports the idea that WADA's lack of authority when imposing the spirit of sport is frequently amplified by the missteps of National and Sports Governing Bodies.<nl><nl>There is not a ‘level playing field’<nl>It may also be argued that the current anti-doping approach does not account for the differences caused by the various settings in which athletes live. This means there is not a fair playing field in sport. Firstly, it is not considered an unfair advantage to live in a wealthy country, yet athletes that do have a significant edge over their rivals from developing countries. Kayser and others argue that these conditions can sometimes come close to doping. <nl>Scholars from developing countries have argued that reaching a world class status in sports often reflects excellent equipment and facilities. Despite this, sport is not a top priority in any developing state. Research suggests that these countries instead rely on imported goods and sponsorships to provide amenities. The outcome is that athletes cannot become involved in ‘sophisticated doping’ in the same way as their competitors since they often lack the resources. Sports facilities in emergent countries are often not maintained because of their financial costs. Consequently, their usage is reduced which leads to a smaller number of local sports competitions. Further, UNESCO suggested in 2013 that there were considerable widespread shortfalls in the quality and quantity of facility and amenity provision, especially in low income countries. For that reason it would be absurd to conclude that talents from developing nations are ever really on a fair playing field, even from a young age. <nl>Corruption in developing countries such as Kenya only compounds these issues. WADA recognised that the doping practices of Kenyan athletes are ‘unsophisticated, opportunistic, and uncoordinated’. This is because testing techniques for older, well-known substances such as Erythropoietin (EPO) are well established meaning its users are easier to spot. The problem is that anti-doping tests are not equally as effective for athletes with access to newer substances. The comparatively unsophisticated doping practises of Kenyan athletes means they are typically caught, and therefore penalised, more often than their competition. This goes to show that a level playing field hardly ever exists.<nl>Operation Aderlass demonstrated these problems in action. In endurance sports, autologous blood doping (ABD), which allows athletes to supply more oxygen to their muscles, has been a big advantage for athletes until discovery., Only then did endurance athletes own up to doing it, probably because they felt that they would be singled out eventually. By contrast, some of Kenya’s highest profile athletes have been identified and banned from their sports because their doping practises were easier to identify. This demonstrates that not all cheaters are treated equally, not because some have committed more serious crimes than others, but because they are committing the same crime with less success.<nl>It may be argued that the nature of this imbalance seriously undermines whether anti-doping efforts are worthwhile and whether they help the spirit of sport. However, it is unfair to expect authorities to always be on top of doping. Still, WADA's anti-doping programmes aim to maintain sport's level playing field. When only certain athletes can use doping to their advantage, these ideals are damaged. As a result of this inequality, talented athletes from developed countries are forced to pursue other opportunities, and the sport suffers the consequences. Ultimately the disparity in doping practises also creates confusion around winners, making it difficult for people to trust whether achievements are the result of hard work or corruption. These are problems that WADA must resolve if it wants to restore confidence in the spirit of sport and offer better opportunities to athletes from developing countries who may risk being left behind if they compete clean.<nl><nl>WADA cannot enforce consequences<nl>'Operation Puerto' in Spain exemplified how WADA has frequently been obstructed in addressing its concerns. Multiple athletes were involved in this sandal. The Criminal Court of Madrid ruled that the evidence discovered by police should be destroyed, a verdict that WADA later challenged. Its former director general, David Howman, argued that ‘at times it seemed as if the intention was to delay any proper approach’. WADA were also unable to name the implicated athletes due to their own statute of limitations policy. <nl>The inability to reveal these facts proves that perceptions of achievement can sometimes be distorted to shield athletes at all costs. In the 2000s, Spanish athletes were worshiped as long as they continued to make Spain a sporting powerhouse (Soule and Kudovic 2011). Dr Fuentes confessed that his clients included athletes from many different sports. One might then argue that Spain and WADA still bear the same burden as in 2006: exposing the facts. A failure to do so not only casts doubt on those in power, but it also calls into question their ability to enforce the WADC. As a consequence, one might argue the values enshrined in the spirit of sport are abandoned at the price of one country.<nl>The implications of Operation Puerto still pale in comparison to those of Russia's state-led anti-doping regime. It involved the director of the anti-doping laboratory in Russia creating a mixture of banned substances that he gave to dozens of Russian athletes, enabling the most controversial doping scheme in history. While WADA endorsed a ban of 4 years, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) substituted a 2 year ban. It also repealed a WADA provision that would have forced Russian athletes to make clear that they were not involved with the scheme. The US anti-doping agency chief suggested the ruling was ‘a catastrophic blow to clean athletes, the integrity of sport, and the rule of law.’<nl>For many this has made it clear that WADA is a substandard organisation when it comes to enforcing its own code. In many countries, WADA must depend on the authorities' willingness to implement effective anti-doping policies and it is clear this scarcely happens. Furthermore, the implementation of the code is contingent governing bodies’ ability to punish the guilty parties for their violations of the code. Instead, these organisations often fall short of their responsibilities, raising doubts about their ability to enforce the code in light of the spirit of sport. This can only come back to bite WADA who are trapped in a vicious circle of making suggestions and not being listened to.<nl>Where it is vital that WADA intervenes it must rely on independent bodies, who have failed to be as unsparing as many would have hoped when bringing the Kremlin to book. Further to that, reinviting Russia's competitors to international competition under the guise of being ‘neutral athletes’ provides no evidence of any real repercussions for sport's most notorious doping scandal. What else could justify a ban on Russian athletes if a state-led doping programme cannot? As a direct result, sporting spirit often is forfeited in the blink of an eye, and it often appears that WADA's eyes are held shut due to their lack of authority. <nl><nl>Legalising doping is flawed<nl>It is only fair that critics of the current approach present alternative views about how doping can be better managed with the aim of promoting the spirit of sport. In that regard doping is difficult to regulate since most appropriate behaviours today can be considered as corrupt in the future. <nl>Some commentators recommend a supervised doping practise. There is a surplus of information on this subject which far exceeds the scope of this essay. The concept, though, can be narrowed down to a few key points: doping cannot be sufficiently safe as long as it is illegal, declaring that doping is unsafe becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy to some degree, since doping often occurs without adequate medical monitoring. They propose allowing medically controlled doping would provide a more solid basis for sports physicians to exercise their duty and fulfil their health-care obligations.<nl>While it is true that theories like principlism in medical ethics place high emphasis on autonomy and non-maleficence, and it is reasonable to believe that legalising doping could further these values, this essay argues that the dangers of controlled doping still outweigh the benefits. Indeed, these principles provide a method to define moral problems rather than provide answers. To begin with it is questionable whether more studies and funding on doping practises will lead to a lower risk to health. Despite decades of research live-saving drugs used to treat sepsis still carry high risks such as becoming deaf. As such, the proposal to minimise the risks associated with doping may be futile, since the current risks are already quite serious.<nl>It would also be difficult to define at what age someone can dope. The response is a proposal to prohibit competitive sports for children to avoid ethical dilemmas. This is obviously unrealistic, given that no nation will produce world class athletes unless young people participate in competitive sports. This moral dilemma is only complicated by athletes with pre-existing medical conditions. Sportspersons with polycystic kidney disease (PKD) have an inherited condition that causes numerous cysts in the kidneys. EPO, a common doping agent, is also produced in the kidneys. The problem is that EPO production is disrupted for these athletes, putting them at a disadvantage. Athletes with PKD would therefore suffer a great degree of inequality if EPO doping was legal. Anyone genetically predisposed to congenital heart condition (they are relatively common) could also be adversely affected by lots of performance enhancing drugs - by stressing the myocardium in such individuals they would be prone to potentially fatal arrhythmia. <nl>Therefore, it is argued that legalising a controlled doping practise would produce perhaps as much injustice as the current system. Sport can, however, proceed in several ways without facilitating the use of substances. The first sub-two-hour marathon ran by Eliud Kipchoge demonstrates how the use of mechanical help can produce new records. For cycling, athletes could use mechanically assisted bikes to help with hilly terrain. This is much safer than doping, however it is WADA that really needs to change.<nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>It has been argued that WADA’s actions have not contributed to the sporting spirit. WADA should have a much bigger say on the enforcement of the code, because its suggestions are often discarded by organisations for whom the spirt of sport is not always a significant objective. The proposal of controlled doping is not a suitable alternative. In the end, if the authors of the universal anti-doping rules are eventually made the ultimate arbiter, it will create an effective governing organisation with more power to actively ensure the spirit of sport.", "<nl><nl>10:30 is fine!<nl><nl>Thanks,<nl><part_FN>.<new>Hi,<nl><nl>It's understandable.

{"id": "8fb4fd10-a52e-43d9-8882-e87a0085bf65", "discourse_types": ["essay", "text_message"], "pair": ["Expression of emotion is one of the key ways in which humans communicate with one another and this expression is executed in many ways through tone of voice, body language (Medjden et al., 2020), the language we speak (Sun et al., 2020) and most importantly, our facial expressions. To effectively communicate with facial expressions, humans need to be able to correctly recognise these emotions and respond appropriately. Here, the question of what constitutes correct recognition of facial displays of emotion arises. This is achieved when the perceiver recognises the emotion intended by the person expressing the emotion. Thus, according to this definition, correct recognition of emotion is very subjective, proving that recognition of facial displays of emotion is a non-universal process. There are many factors that determine the non-universality of this phenomenon, but for this essay, only three factors will be discussed: 1) culture (Widen et al., 2011), 2) gender (Spies and Sevincer, 2018), and 3) mental illness (Uljaravic and Hamilton, 2013). This essay reviews the literature surrounding these factors and aims to support the argument of correct recognition of facial displays of emotion being non-universal with a wide range of convergent evidence.<nl><nl>The main factor to consider when arguing that recognition of facial displays is not universal is the role of culture. There has been vast amount of research that proves that culture does indeed influence emotion recognition. For example, studies by Widen et al (2011) found that culture influences the recognition of the basic emotions (Ekman and Friesen 1976). They conducted two studies: the first one involved 88 university students from Boston college rating 10 different facial expressions – first with a free label format and then with a forced-choice format. The second study employed the exact same method, but they increased the list of choices in the forced-choice task to include the three most commonly mentioned states (confused, thinking, suspicious) and a \"none of the above\" option. They found that although there was moderate agreement on the predicted emotion when assessed with forced choice (study 1: 58%; study 2: 42%), there was significantly low agreement when participants were assessed with free labelling (study 1: 18%; study 2: 16%). Therefore, this contrast in agreement in the different conditions possibly suggest that the options presented in a forced choice task may influence and shape their answer, meaning it is not the ideal task type to use when conducting emotion recognition research. Moreover, free labelling tasks have more ecological validity, making them more valid than forced choice tasks. <nl><nl>However, as with any psychological research, this study has limitations. While the researchers made sure to include individuals from various backgrounds in their sample size, the main drawback is that all of the participants had some exposure to Western, US culture as they were all university students at an American university. This means that even participants who maybe were not US citizens, still had been exposed to Western culture to an extent which may have influenced their answers and thus, the data of the culturally diverse participants would not be as accurate as if they had never moved to the US. Therefore, it is important to consider research that has employed participants from non-Western backgrounds. <nl><nl>Neuroimaging research conducted by Harada et al (2020) shows emotion recognition is influenced by culture by showing that neural activity in certain brain areas was different among participants from different ethnic backgrounds and that in-group biases influenced this activity. The study involved 3 groups of participants; native Japanese (JP) individuals who lived in Japan, Caucasian Americans (CA) and Japanese Americans (JA) both of which lived in the US. The study involved an fMRI scan of the participants while they completed an emotional face and perceptual matching task, viewing stimuli of either Japanese or Caucasian faces depicting negative emotions (fear or anger) or simple shapes that served as control. The results of this study show that in-group biases and collectivistic values influence cultural modulation of neural response in the bilateral amygdala. Furthermore, bi-cultural JAs showed enhanced neural responses in the ventral medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices during the perception of Japanese negative facial expression which suggests greater sensitivity to ingroup biases in individuals from more than one culture. Thus, this study is a prime example of how culture can shape emotion recognition – if this was a universal phenomenon, then all participants would have had the same level of neural activity in the amygdala however that was not the case. Furthermore, the researchers also made sure to select participants from collectivist cultures – those who had never been exposed to individualistic cultures – which make the data more reliable as it is less likely to be influenced by Western norms. As culture plays a significant role in influencing emotion recognition of facial displays of emotion, credibility to the belief that emotion recognition is non-universal is given.<nl><nl>Another factor to consider when discussing whether correct recognition of facial displays of emotion is a universal process is the role of gender. Research has shown that gender influences emotion perception and recognition among humans. Indeed, a study conducted by Spies and Sevincer (2018) showed that women were much better than men at recognising whether smiles were genuine or not. They used a behavioural experimental paradigm whereby they had participants judge single and adjacent photos. The single photos involved both authentic and unauthentic smiles and participants were required to indicate which smile they thought the photo showed. The adjacent photos involved photos of the same person depicting either an authentic smile or an unauthentic smile. The results showed that women outperformed men in differentiating the two types of smiles in the adjacent photos condition. This therefore suggests that gender does play a role in recognition of facial displays of emotion. <nl><nl>However, it is important to note that this study only explores gender influence in this area in only one type of experimental paradigm – a forced choice test. An issue with this type of test is that it lacks ecological validity as in real life, people differentiate facial displays of emotion through various means for example, via their eyes. Indeed, a study by Hall et al (2009), using eye tracking techniques, found that women were quicker and more accurate in recognising expressions than men and they looked more at the eyes of the person in the photo stimuli than men. Thus, this study shows that by even using a different experimental technique (other than a forced choice task) gender differences in recognition of facial displays of emotion are still evident. <nl><nl>Mental illnesses also have proven to be an influencing factor in the correct recognition of facial displays of emotion. In a meta-analysis study by Uljarevic and Hamilton (2013), it was found that autistic individuals found it difficult to recognise facial displays of emotion. The systematic review involved 48 papers that all employed a behavioural study paradigm, that is, participants in the study were required to do a type of behavioural task. The results of this meta-analysis found a large negative effect size that suggests the autistic individuals have a general impairment in emotion recognition. <nl><nl>However, it is too presumptive to claim that the findings of this meta-analysis are applicable to other research investigating the role of mental illnesses on recognition of emotions using different experimental paradigms, i.e. those that deal with neuro-psychological data that is obtained through neuro-imaging techniques or other physiological methods. As highlighted before, the above study looked at studies that employed behavioural tasks. It is important to establish whether the findings of that study would still be prevalent when alternative techniques are used. <nl><nl>In support of this, a meta-analysis study conducted by Cuve et al (2018) found similar results to the previous study, but their analysis included physiological and eye-tracking studies. This study involved a review of 21 studies and the results showed that the majority of the studies suggested that individuals with autism show a level of active or reflexive avoidance to the eyes, consequently missing the subtle social cues conveyed through this particular body part. The eyes are a crucial part of the body in that they play a significant role in processing emotional expressions, especially negatives ones such as fear and sadness (Scheller et al 2012). <nl><nl>Therefore, in line with the previous meta-analytic study discussed in this essay, the findings of this study also suggest that individuals with autism struggle recognising facial displays of emotion, especially negative emotion. Thus, with research that strongly supports the notion that mental illnesses play a role in influencing recognition of facial displays of behaviour, the notion that this phenomenon is not universal but rather dependent on many factors is proven to be more credible.<nl><nl>Overall, the non-universality of correct recognition of facial displays of emotion is widely researched. The factors discussed in this essay all influence emotion recognition of facial displays in distinct ways; it seems individuals from different cultures perceive facial emotions differently, women, more than men, are more likely to correctly recognise facial displays of emotion and autistic individuals generally have a difficulty in distinguishing and thus recognising different emotions. It also important to note that while emotion recognition of faces can involve either positive or negative emotions, it is more often the case that these factors play a bigger role when individuals are required to distinguish between negative faces rather than positive ones. That is, non-universality of correct recognition of facial displays of emotion is more evident in negative emotions than positive ones.", " 😭😭😭😭<new>Is it Auntie <pers_FN>’s birthday? Xx<new>Hi mum!

{"id": "daed5a9b-5778-4ce5-8568-2ec199ce7d3e", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["<question1><nl><nl>ASD is a neurodevelopmental condition, characterised by the co-occurrence of impairments in social interaction, communication development and restrictedrepetitive behaviours (RRBs) (Bakhtiari et al (2012). Advances in brain scanning techniques seen in the past two decades (such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)), has provided a unique opportunity to assess brain connectivity and how differences relative to the neurotypical brain, may contribute to the profile of behaviours seen in ASD.<nl><nl>Underconnectivity theory hypothesises that ASD and its characteristic deficits is caused as a direct result of under functioning in integrative circuitry, that results in an impairment of information integration at neuralcognitive levels (Just et al., 2004).  Just et al (2004) tested this hypothesis, using 17 high functioning ASD individuals compared with typically developing (TD) matched controls, paired on the basis of verbal IQ. All participants completed a sentence comprehension task whilst in an fMRI scanner, assessing functional connectivity between the language areas of the brain. It was found that ASD individuals showed a large systematic difference in distribution of brain activity relative to TD controls, with posterior left superior temporal gyrus (Wernicke’s area) activation being greater in ASD and left inferior frontal gyrus (Broca’s area) activation greater in control participants. Furthermore, it was seen that functional connectivity between the language areas in ASD was lower throughout the cortical language systems in comparison to controls. Just et al (2004) suggests these findings have implications for the behaviours seen in ASD, namely atypical strengths in processing single words but deficits in interpreting complex sentences and stories. This may in turn account for the difficulties seen in ASD when interpreting homographs (Happé, 2011). It is speculated that this underconnectivity between cortical regions applies to other higher-level functions. Research assessing theory of mind (ToM), specifically mentalising, in ASD individuals supports this (Castelli et al., 2002). Castelli et al (2002) found that individuals with ASD were less accurate and offered less interpretations during a mental state attribution task relative to controls and that this correlated with reduced activation in the brain’s mentalising network. Despite support from other literature, caution should be taken when interpreting Just et al’s (2004) findings because of its low external validity. Only a small sample size was used, including only high functioning Caucasian individuals, meaning it cannot capture and account for the broad spectrum of ASD and the wider population. <nl>White matter (WM) is key for efficient and synchronised communication between brain regions, underpinning the foundation of brain connectivity (Dean et al., 2016). Research suggests atypical WM microstructure may account for the deficits seen in ASD. Bakhtiari et al (2012) assessed this in ASD participants compared to neurotypical (NT) individuals using Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI). It was found that ASD participants showed decreased fractional anisotropy values (FA), bilaterally spanning over a large brain region relative to controls, telling of maldevelopment in WM. These decreased FA values in ASD individuals correlated with social and communication difficulties, assessed using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) and Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R). Regions displaying decreased FA in WM tracts included those implicated in emotional face processing (inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus), language (inferior longitudinal fasciculus) and executive function (inferior and superior longitudinal fasciculi, which is linked to attention). A limitation of Bakhtiari et al’s (2012) study is that participants were not screened for other neurological conditions i.e. schizophrenia and ADHD which have also been identified as showing abnormalities in WM, namely low FA relative to controls (Davenport et al., 2010). Furthermore, Bakhtiari et al’s findings do not account for RRBs seen in ASD, with research suggesting an association between high FA values and RRBs (Cheung et al., 2009). This shows that the picture surrounding WM and the ASD behaviours is not completely clear yet and future research should seek to address this.<nl>To conclude abnormal brain connectivity appears to play an integral role in the profile of behaviours and differences in cognitive function seen in those with ASD. Underconnectivity theory arguably provides a robust account of language as well as ToM deficits seen in ASD (Just et al., 2004; Castelli et al., 2002). Meanwhile low FA values, indicative of WM disruption in ASD, can account for impairments in social and communication domains (Just et al., 2004). As mentioned above, DTI literature has also shown increased FA values corelating with RRBs seen in ASD (Cheung et al.,2009).  Some researchers suggest atypical brain connectivity underpins the differences seen in ASD, going as far as to suggest it is the first firm finding in ASD research (see Hughes, 2007).<nl><nl><question2><nl><nl>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly heterogenous neurological disorder, defined and diagnosed by the co-occurrence of impairments in communication, social interaction and the existence of restrictedrepetitive behaviours and interests in an individual (Lai &amp; Baron-Cohen, 2015). Some researchers suggest that ASD is a fractionable disorder (Happé et al., 2006). Those in support of fractionation argue that there is no single cause for the symptomology seen in ASD and it may be speculated that this is contributing to the ‘lost generation’ of ASD individuals (see Lai &amp; Baron-Cohen, 2015) whose needs may not be being met (Happé, 2006). Evidence in support of fractionation theory, largely comes from research into the broader autism phenotype (BAP), defined as subclinical level of ASD symptoms within the general population, that exist outside of the threshold for an ASD diagnosis (Sasson et al., 2013). <nl><nl>ASD is as a highly heritable disorder with estimates as high as 90% (Losh et al., 2009). This genetic liability has been shown by family research to translate in unaffected relatives of ASD individuals as milder, subclinical expressions of the triad, identifiable as the BAP (Losh et al., 2009). Losh et al’s (2009) assessed the BAP in the parents of ASD diagnosed individuals (n=83) using a battery of well-established tasks, measuring ASD symptoms across the triad. <nl>Losh et al (2009) found that of the ASD parents, 22 were identified as positive for social BAP characteristics and 34 identified as positive for rigidperfectionist BAP characteristics. Parents demonstrating social BAP performed significantly less accurately relative to controls on the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test and similar results were observed across all 6 social cognition measures. However, this was not seen as plainly for tasks assessing executive function and central coherence. This demonstrates the validity of the BAP in parents of ASD individuals and suggest its componential nature, supporting the fractionation of the triad of impairments. However, Losh et al’s research did not control for other disorders such as schizophrenia, which has been proven to have phenotypic similarities to ASD, that also impair social cognition (Sasson et al., 2007). Research seeking to replicate this study should pre-screen for such disorders that could affect ability in tasks, to confirm finding specificity to ASD.<nl><nl><nl>Low to moderate inter-corelations between the triad domains of impairment in ASD individuals has been outlined by researchers as evidence in favour of the fractionation theory (Happé et al., 2006). Conversely, Murray et al (2014) suggests this may be a product of range restriction, underestimating the inter-corelation between traits in those diagnosed. It is argued that studies use of clinical samples represents only the extremes of ASD symptoms because of simultaneous selection in diagnosis, therefore attenuating trait variance and its corelation with other variables. Testing this Murray et al (2014) used a simulation study of 10,000,000 cases showing impairments in all 3 domains, to replicate diagnosis and compared this with real population data from 236 non ASD participants and 148 participants diagnosed with high functioning ASD or Asperger’s. Results showed significantly low inter-corelations between triad domains in the simulation study compared to the population study corelation. It was argued that this demonstrates the attenuation of inter-correlations between traits when simultaneous selection occurs. Murray suggest that investigations of ASD symptom inter-corelations should use both clinical samples and non-diagnosed participants, if we are to assume the characteristic of ASD exist on a continuum within the general population. This conversely suggests that using the general population can serve to facilitate the argument that ASD is a coherent, non-fractionable disorder. With this being said, the use of a simulation to reflect the ASD diagnosis process lacks ecological validity and cannot fully capture the character of the selection process in diagnosis, meaning cautions should be taken when drawing conclusions. Furthermore, this study is not reflective of the broad spectrum of ASD as only high-functioning individuals were sampled meaning it cannot account for low-functioning individuals. <nl><nl><nl>To conclude the BAP has been influential in identifying the genetic basis of ASD with a wealth of family-based research supporting this claim (Losh et al., 2009; Constantino &amp; Todd, 2005). However, it remains the case that no single gene can account for all aspects of triad, implying that they may be instead be symptom specific (Happé et al., 2006). Research with the general population and those displaying the BAP can also be used in support of ASD being a coherent disorder as suggested by Murray et al (2014). Future research should aim to control for simultaneous, clarifying triad symptom correlations.", "at thank you so much! <new>Dear <addr8_FN>,<nl><nl>Following an email from <university>, I am enquiring about how to apply to become a volunteer with <organisation>?<nl><nl><nl>Kind regards <part_FN_SN>.<new>Hello,<nl><nl>I would like to confirm that I am opting out of a placement year and would like to progress on to final year.<nl><nl>Many thanks <part_FN_SN><new>They were all returned in the same parcel.<new>﻿The tracking number is:<nl><nl><id_number> <nl><nl>The order was returned from <road> post office. <nl><nl>Many thanks <part_FN>.<new>Hope you are well.<nl><nl>I emailed you last week regarding opting out of a placement year when I was re enrolling I was still on a placement year.

{"id": "97f10546-0e8c-4c97-957d-773b1ce4de8a", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["\"Intro <nl>The Alpha Inhibition Hypothesis (AIH) is when high alpha is indicative of inhibition and disengagement of task irrelevant brain areas.  the current experiment tested the alpha inhibition hypothesis using a cued visual attention task and predicted that; if recording from the left parietal lobe participants' alpha range activities would be higher in the cue left than cue right condition.<nl>Method<nl>A partial replication of an experiment was conducted, and it included recording alpha amplitudes from the left parietal lobe (P3), analysing the activity 200ms before stimulus onset in the cue left and cue right conditions.<nl>Results <nl>The results were significant and were consistent with the hypothesis. It can be concluded that the results supported the theory that cue left would be higher than cue right amplitudes when recording from P3. <nl>Experiment write up, 1200 +- 10% (min1080, max1320) words, titles, title page tables, figures &amp; reference list not included in count<nl>Introduction<nl>The AIH, states that more alpha activity in one hemisphere leads to loss of attention and the disengagement of task irrelevant brain areas (the other hemisphere), this indicates inhibition. Whereas less activity in one hemisphere leads to the opposite; an increase in attention and engagement (Klimesch et al., 2007). Alpha activity or waves are a type of brain wave. They are produced in circumstances of rest, especially when your eyes are closed and happen before you fall asleep (Alpha Waves and How They Help You Sleep, n.d.). <nl>The AIH is supported with research such as (Handel et al., 2011) who used a MEG (magneto-encephalogram) which has better spatial resolution and similar temporal resolution to an EEG for better results. They found that alpha activity is reduced in contralateral brain areas to the stimuli presented, that alpha activity is influenced by attention. <nl>A partial replication of Sauseng et al.’s (2005) experiment: \"A shift of visual spatial attention is selectively associated with human EEG alpha activity\", was conducted to compare alpha amplitudes at P3 between conditions and prove the hypothesis that cue left would be higher than cue right amplitudes when recording from P3. As stimuli always processes contralaterally (opposite side of activity) We wanted to find out whether if, a side of the visual field was cued, would it lead to alpha inhibition on the contralateral side where participants anticipated the stimuli would appear? And which side would show bigger alpha amplitudes?<nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants<nl>38 undergraduate students took part in the research via volunteer sampling, there were originally 39, but one participant’s data were removed as their data were only available for one of the two conditions. <nl>Design<nl>The design of the study was a repeated measure, the independent variable was whether the arrow cues pointed left or right, it also had two levels known as cue left and cue right. The dependent variable was the alpha amplitudes measured in µV (microvolts), recorded from P3.<nl>Materials<nl>A Biopac MP36 was used to collect data and EEG Electrodes were attached to participants’ scalps using AC cream, Everi cream. PsychoPy software was used to present stimuli for a specific period of time and send event markers set to end immediately to Biopac, through a Stimtracker device. The Stimuli used were two white bars on a black background, one large, one small (see figure 1). Two arrows, one pointing left and one pointing right (see figure 2). And white fixation cross (see figure 3). <nl><figure><nl><nl>Procedure<nl>Firstly, the Biopac channel was set up to record raw EEG 0.5-35Hz, digital channels were set up to receive event markers from PsychoPy and Stimtracker, event markers let us know when stimuli were shown. Calculation channels were set up to record activity in the alpha frequency range from 8-13Hz before checking the impedance, with the sampling rate being 1000 Hz, alpha amplitudes were also measured.  Participants had EEG electrodes with AC cream on them placed on their scalps using the 1020 positioning system (Trans-Cranial Techologies.,2012), with P3 being recorded. The active electrode was placed at P3, the reference electrode was attached to Fz, an earth electrode was attached to the forehead near the hairline and everything was measured relative to Cz.The areas were scrubbed with Everi cream beforehand for better adhesion. They were then asked to complete a cued visual attention task using PsychoPy. <nl>Cued with a fixation cross at the centre of the screen for 34ms an arrow indicating whether it would be the left or right side of the visual field the target, would appear, in the centre of the screen for 34ms whilst participants were asked by the experimenter to focus their attention to that side of the visual field. There was 50% chance of being cued left or right. There were different event markers for cue left and right conditions and they were sent at stimulus onset. There were 20 blocks of 4 trial types, each block had cued right small bar, cued left small bar, cued right large bar, and cued left large bar) randomised within blocks with half of trials cued left and half cued right. <nl><nl>Results<nl>The raw 9-13Hz Alpha EEG data for each condition was analysed using the event markers sent from PsychoPy to identify when the stimuli would be presented. We looked at the period of 200ms of recorded activity before stimulus presentation, after arrow cues had been shown and used Biopac by rectifying and averaging over 50 samples of raw alpha data to show alpha activity regardless of whether it was excitatory or inhibitory. This smooths out the data (averaging over samples), reduces the impact of outlyingextreme values and converts negative values to positive, so we get an average deviation from 0 in microvolts. <nl>Statistical Analysis<nl>Table 1 shows that the rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA) were higher in the cue left condition than the cue right condition. According to the Wilcoxon signed rank test, the difference was significant, and the inferential statistics are as follows (t=566, n=38, p&lt;0.005). <nl><nl>Discussion<nl>The results were significant, so we used a non-parametric test to find the inferential statistics from the data collected. The results fit with the hypothesis as the results are consistent with AIH as recorded activity from P3cue left were higher than cue right, which were the task irrelevant brain areas, suggesting that alpha suppression happened there.<nl>Methodological issues that could have affected the results could have been varying levels of impedance, associated with more variance in the measurements but would affect both conditions equally. Another methodological issue that could have affected results could have been artefacts, such as blinking, that would affect the waves. From the experiment overall, I conclude that the AIH is highly supported by research as it has high temporal reliability, and despite all the methodological issues, the results are still valid.\"", "<addr8_FN>,<nl><nl>Hope you’re well and sorry for the late reply.

{"id": "699acd6b-e042-4bad-a55e-482185ab36a6", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Both the biological and psychoanalytic approaches seek to explain human behaviour. The biological approach proposes the idea that all psychological problems are rooted in physiological causes, whereas the psychoanalytic approach suggests that behaviour is due to unconscious forces and childhood experiences. The key features of these approaches are distinct from each other and have their uses and limitations, yet, both are still widely used in psychology. <nl><nl>The biological approach prevails over other psychological approaches due to the fact that its explanations encompass anatomy, physiology and the role of neurological function. This approach accepts the idea of materialism as it assumes that all behaviour has a physical basis. This opposes the previously accepted idea of dualism, in which it was believed that the body and the mind are separate but interacting entities. The shift from dualism to materialism was supported with work by Paul Broca (1861). In studying a patient called ‘Tan’, Broca discovered that there was a direct link between the articulation of speech and damage to a particular cortical region. This area was later named ‘Broca’s area’ and pioneered the idea that particular cognitive functions can be localised to areas in the cerebral cortex (Grodzinsky &amp; Amunts, 2006). <nl><nl>Localisation of brain function is a central concept to the biological approach. Broca (1861) and Wernicke’s (1874) findings were some of the first to show that damage to cortical areas produces a change in language. A significant drawback of these findings was that they were concluded from limited post-mortem evidence, which makes it difficult to show the specificity of location. The mechanism of speech may be something that is controlled by multiple areas, so damage to any one of these areas may produce the same effect (Myers, 2007). <nl><nl>Recent research by Delgado and Hamlin (1956) demonstrated how stimulation of the motor cortex using electrodes led to specific physical reactions. In one individual the left motor cortex was stimulated, and it was found that the right fist would clench. This provided support for the latter idea that the cerebral cortex is split into four lobes, each relating to a different function (Carlson &amp; Birkett, 2017). <nl><nl>Another feature of the biological perspective is the idea of brain communication through the use of neurotransmitters. These chemicals are involved in regulating processes in the body such as emotion. If there is a biochemical imbalance in these systems, this may in turn affect human behaviour. A review by Seo and Patrick (2008) demonstrated how a deficiency in serotonin combined with high levels of dopamine interact together in the prefrontal cortex and may predispose individuals to aggressive behaviour. This follows the diathesis-stress model in stating how irregularities in biological systems may predispose individuals to certain conditions which manifest after being triggered. This shows that contrary to general assumption, the biological approach does not entirely ignore the role of nature in human behaviour. It acknowledges that biology may be just the precursor to abnormal behaviour. <nl><nl>Empiricism is an essential component in understanding the functioning behind biological systems. Experiments such as Delgado and Hamlin, (1956) and Seo and Patrick, (2008) show that being deeply embedded in the observational methods of science provides an advantage of the biological approach over others. This level of empiricism means that studies can be easily replicated. Likewise, the possibility of direct manipulation of a variable and the observation of the response means that valid conclusions can be drawn. From this, researchers are then able to take away evidence that helps support concepts such as neurotransmitter effects. <nl><nl>As the biological approach follows the law of parsimony, it often finds itself being criticised for being too reductionist. Complex behaviour is simplified down to individual physiological mechanisms. For example, the concept of being able to produce language is reduced to the interactions between neurones in the frontal lobe when the explanation behind this may be far more intricate. This approach is also deterministic as biological processes are exempt from our free will. If aggression is due to neurotransmitter abnormality, this suggests that there is no control over the behaviour exhibited. However, evidence by Van Lier, Vitaro and Eisner (2007) has shown how peer rejection in children can lead to maladaptive behaviours, including aggression. This demonstrates how an environmental rather than a biological factor can lead to an individual choosing to express their aggressive behaviour. <nl><nl>An alternative to this is the psychoanalytic approach which was developed by Sigmund Freud in 1896. One of the concepts Freud introduced was that personality development is moulded by childhood experiences and fixations, namely the psychosexual stages of development. He theorised that all children go through the oral, anal, phallic, latency and genital stages in which the individual is focused on obtaining pleasure through the specific areas. In each of these stages, there is the possibility for fixation to occur. If this occurs at any stage, personality development into adulthood may be affected (Fennald, 1997). A second concept is that personality is split into the id, ego and superego which are unconscious forces that influence our decisions and motives. The id contains sexual instincts (libido) and aggressive instincts (Eysenck, 1988). The superego reflects the moral standards of society, restricting the id from making decisions which would not be allowed and the ego is the decision maker, mediating between the two (Jarvis, 2000). <nl>There is substantial contemporary evidence to suggest that Freud was correct in some of his propositions, like his idea of unconscious cognitive processes. Research by Westen (1999) looks to explain how the activation of particular unconscious associative networks influences ongoing thoughts, feelings and behaviour outside our awareness. Westen theorised that when networks associated with a particular situation are activated, this spreads to other neural networks and increases the likelihood of interpreting a situation in a certain way. This supports Freud’s idea by showing how a previous experience, stored in the unconscious, is able to influence future interactions. <nl><nl>The psychoanalytic approach has advantages over the biological approach by taking a multifaceted view and acknowledging both sides of the nature-nurture debate. The role of nature is considered in how innate drives influence our thoughts, and the role of nurture in how childhood experiences elicit behaviour. Consequently, this approach has similarities with the biological in assuming determinism. Behaviour in adult life is affected by the fixation of libido which suggests that we are shaped by irrepressible forces that are exempt from free will. <nl><nl>The scientific status of the psychoanalytic approach is called into question on multiple occasions which puts it at a disadvantage to the biological approach. Variables are not manipulated, which makes it difficult to produce causal conclusions, and therefore leads to issues with the falsifiability. Freud’s theories were based upon untested observations in a purely therapeutic situation. Qualitative research derived from case studies are a less reliable source of information and Freud only used 12 over the lifespan of his published work (Eysenck, 2000). However, more contemporary research by Fonagy and Bateman (1999) has shown how the psychoanalytic approach has evolved over time to incorporate more controlled data-gathering methods. In order to test the effectiveness of psychoanalytically oriented partial hospitalisation as a treatment for borderline personality disorder (BPD), Fonagy and Bateman (1999) conducted a randomised control trial and assessed outcome measures such as number of admissions, frequency of suicide attempts and symptom distress. There was a well-structured methodological approach to this study, including the use of DSM-III-R criteria to assess for BPD before participants were randomly assigned to the two groups. This study is an example of how the psychoanalytic approach should not be completely disregarded as non-scientific as current research looks to improve the legitimacy of methods that are used. <nl><nl>In conclusion, the biological and the psychoanalytic approach parallel each other in terms of their determinism and their perspective on nature. However, the biological approach has an advantage over the psychoanalytic approach as it is empirical and has a strong scientific basis which supports its credibility. <nl><nl>The early concepts of the psychoanalytic approach are difficult to falsify but on the other hand, contemporary psychoanalytic research has since developed to include more rigorous scientific procedures. Despite issues with both approaches, key features have their place in psychology today with localisation of brain function, the action of neurotransmitters and unconscious cognitive processes still being widely accepted.", "<addr25_FN>,<nl><nl>My friend and I have found an <business> flight and we have enlisted with the consulate, I got offered free cancellation for 24 hours so I just booked it incase it sells out, but please let me know if <university> want to look into different options as I will be able to cancel mine<nl><nl>Sorry for all this stress,<nl><nl><part_FN><new>Hi <addr14_FN>,<nl><nl> <nl><nl>Sorry for not contacting you sooner, my flight back to the UK sadly didn’t go ahead as planned, ended up having to pay £1,600 for a 50 hour flight via <city>.. has taken me a while to get back into the swing of things, I hope your daughter got back okay!<nl><nl> <nl><nl>I was just wondering if there’s any possibility of getting an extension on the placement workpresentation?

Stroop, was designed to study the effect of interference when presented with pairs of conflicting stimuli (Stroop, 1935). This original study showed that the verbal identification of the colour of a word is delayed by the word being a colour-word and incongruent to the font colour (Allport, 1990).<nl>The Stroop Test shows the effect of inhibition, a central executive function used to override an immediate response to a stimulus, demonstrated by the overriding of the semantic meaning of the word shown in order to correctively identify the font colour (Eysenck &amp; Keane, 2015).<nl>It is also an example of automaticity in reading (Hunt &amp; Ellis, 2004). Automatic processes are not conducted with intent, they are not able to be thought through before they happen, and do not take up any conscious processing capacity; The Stroop test demonstrates this with the automaticity involved when the stimulus is first seen (Posner &amp; Snyder, 1975).<nl>The fact that the Stroop test covers so many aspects of cognitive processing makes it a significant study in the field of cognitive psychology. Variations of the study also provide a range of results on which hypotheses can be based.<nl>Based on past research, it is predicted that when the colours are incongruent, the time taken to respond to the font colour will be longer in comparison to when the colours are congruent.<nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants<nl>123 participants were used from a volunteer sample of Aston University 1st Year Psychology students, ranging from approximately 18-22 years old.<nl>Design<nl>The study was a within subjects design, with each participant responding to both congruent and incongruent stimuli, this being the independent variable; whether the font colour was congruent with the colour meaning of the word. The dependent variable was the response time for the participants to report the colour of the font.<nl>Materials<nl>Superlab was used to create and conduct the study, and using the Superlab timing feature enabled accurate response times to be obtained.<nl>A set of simple jpeg images were used as stimuli. These showed various colour words in various coloured fonts (red, blue, green, or yellow), with half of the stimuli’s meaning and font colour being the same (congruent) or different (incongruent).<nl>The participants could use Superlab’s response option to input the font colour of each stimulus using a set of coloured computer keys, and once having familiarised themselves with the order of the keys they were able to respond as soon as they had processed the colour of the stimuli.<nl><nl>Procedure<nl>Firstly, participants were given a full briefing on the experiment and it’s aims, as past studies had shown that there was little-to-no effect of participants knowing the experiment aims. They were asked to sign a consent form, allowing their data to be used in the experiment report. <nl>Instructions were given verbally; however, this was unnecessary as all participants were already familiar with the experiment. Participants were instructed to respond as quickly as possible to the font colour of the stimuli, but ignore the meaning of the words shown. The participants were told to respond by tapping a coloured computer key corresponding with their response. Their response times were recorded by the Superlab program.<nl>The stimuli were presented one at a time in a random order, with congruence and incongruence also randomised and counterbalanced.<nl><nl>Results<nl>Only 115 out of the total 123 participants inputted results, causing n to equal 115.<nl><table><nl>There was a significant difference between colour congruent and colour incongruent conditions                (T = 1932.00, n = 115, p &lt; 0.001). As mean reaction times were larger in the incongruent condition than in the congruent condition, the participants took significantly longer to identify font colours when they were incongruent with the meaning of the colour word. The standard deviations suggest that there was a high variance in both conditions, but more variance in the incongruent condition than the congruent condition.<nl><nl>Discussion<nl>The results obtained from the experiment showed that participants took significantly longer to correctly respond to the font colour stimulus when the font colour was incongruent with the word meaning than when the font colour was congruent. This is concurrent with past experiments in the same area and is consistent with the original hypothesis. <nl>The results collected can be used to explain many aspects of perception and internal processing. The fact that the semantic meaning of the stimulus words can affect the time taken to respond to the visual colour of the font supports the Flanker Effect (Sanders &amp; Lamers, 2002) and in turn the theory of Late Attentional Selection (Lavie &amp; Tsal, 1994), as it suggests that unattended stimuli can influence our conscious thoughts and actions.<nl>However, there were some methodological issues with this study. In this experiment, every participant received a slightly differently worded brief as there was no standardised instructions created for the study and all briefs were given by different investigators. There was also the issue of multiple trial situations. Sections of the participant group undertook the study at different times of day, different days and in different rooms. This may have influenced the results collected and should have been controlled for by having all participants complete the study at the same time under the same conditions.<nl>There is a wide range of modifications to this experiment that could be made to study the different aspects of the original Stroop test, one of which is to explore the effects of context and internal state of participants on response time. Again, there are several ways this could be conducted in order to produce evidence to support real world debates, one of which is to test the effects of chemical imbalances on the Stroop test. Although it could be modified further to make it more applicable to the real world, at a basic level the original Stroop test could be conducted under the influence of various chemical substances, e.g. Alcohol, to test the effects of these chemicals on perception of target stimuli in the presence of distractors.<nl>", " was your day?? xx<new>When do you expect to hear back from them?? xx<new>Awww nice.

Managers are obliged to ensure workplaces offer senses of belongingness and motivation, but this was not your experience. <nl><nl>You can argue breach of Job clause, because Narinder asked you to perform duties outside your contract which were unreasonable, given you are a cameraman and not a speaker. Narinder transferred you to Accounting, which is not the job responsibilities expected from a cameraman. This may give rise to a breach in your renumeration clause, because your accounting transfer, may have increased your salary and should be paid accordingly. Your resulting consequential loss resulting is your resignation and lack of work.<nl><nl>Eligibility to bring WDC, requires the claimant to be an employee. Applying the legal test of an employee, did you wear uniform whilst working? Were you integrated and controlled by WW employees? As your manager, Narinder assigned you projects. You used a company car. This validates you were sufficiently integrated and controlled within WW, deeming you an employee. <nl><nl>The law requires the claimant must be dismissed by their employer, under misconduct. WW did not dismiss you, but you resigned. The law recognises resignations as constructive dismissal, providing it has been done at a reasonable time, justified through contractual breaches and is evidenced in writing. You telephoned Narinder your resignation notice, giving reasons. This does not take imminent, legal effect because you must provide your resignation in writing. I advise you email Narinder your resignation notice, for this will reach Narinder faster. Following this, you will be eligible to bring WDC against WW. <nl><nl>Can you bring an Unfair Dismissal Claim against Wildlife Wonders?<nl>To bring an Unfair Dismissal Claim (UDC), the law requires the employer to defend the claimant’s claim. You are likely to succeed with UDC against WW, so I shall focus on this. <nl><nl>To be lawfully eligible, the claimant must be an employee. Following my explanation in WDC section, you satisfy this. Law places two additional requirements. Firstly, the claimant must not be excluded from claiming due to their occupation. A cameraman is very unlikely to be excluded and you have not signed a compromising agreement with WW. Secondly, the claimant must have worked for their employee for a continuous period of two years. you have worked for WW for ten years, allowing you eligibility to bring UDC.  <nl><nl>Procedural requirements<nl>Regarding time limits, the law established a 3 months minus one day from effective date of termination, deadline for WDC submitted to tribunals. WDC submitted to court have 6 year deadline.  If you resigned on 28th November 2020, you have until 27th February 2021 to submit your WDC to a tribunal. You will have until 27th November 2026 to submit your WDC to court. As you want to bring a WDC and UDC, you are advised to bring both claims to a tribunal. As your salary is £52,000, any award exceeding £25,000 will be taxed and presented in court. Bringing both claims, means your legal fees is likely to be subtracted from your compensation, allowing you to bring your claims to a tribunal.  <nl><nl>I advise you submit your WDC to the tribunal as soon as possible, I am happy to assist you with this. The tribunal requires you to attend Early Conciliation meeting to settle your dispute. ACAS is an independent statutory body, aiming to provide early conciliations. You will receive a certificate number which must be presented to the tribunal as evidence of attempted conciliation. If the dispute is not resolved with WW, the tribunal will give you an additional month to submit your WDC to them. You will have until 27 March 2021 to submit WDC. You still remain an employee of WW, as you have not evidenced your resignation in writing and have not been dismissed.<nl><nl>Like WDC, the law requires the claimant to have been dismissed by their employer. You must prove you have been dismissed from WW, namely confirming your resignation in writing. Like WDC, in UDC you must attend ACAS hearing, in an attempt to settle your dispute.  <nl><nl>If you choose to formally resign and have attended ACAS hearing, you must attach the certificate number onto the ET1 Tribunal Claim Form. I am happy to assist in completing this. This will be sent to WW, who will have 28 days to respond to your claim through the ET3 Tribunal Claim Form. <nl><nl>What would be the prospects of you succeeding with each claim?<nl>You have the burden to prove your WDC and UDC. As I stated, you are likely to successfully justify both claims. Once WW have received your ET1 Form, the burden will be on them to defend your claim. They must justify their actions as being reasonable, supporting your employment contract. Narinder will attempt to argue she was reasonable in sending you to different countries for projects,  as your job is to film nature. However, Narinder was unreasonable in being disrespectful to you. Given Narinder’s lack of knowledge and your strong reputation, Narinder should have understood you. <nl><nl>Narinder has not justified her reasons for transferring you to accounting, knowing it is outside your contract and you dislike it. This represents an unjustifiable breach in your job clause, as you were not contracted to deliver talks and work in accountancy but contracted to film creatures. Narinder is unlikely to successfully justify her disrespectful comments to you. Also, you did not consent to your performance issues (should remain confidential) being publicised. <nl><nl>WDC Prospect<nl>It is unlikely WW will succeed in defending your claim, unless it amounts to gross misconduct, or WW reverse their decision of you working in Accounting department and allow you to resume working as a cameraman. <nl><nl>A tribunal will lawfully consider gross misconduct, as evidence of the employee breaching their contract, so bad that it damages the relationship between the employer and employee. This would allow the employer to dismiss the employee, without worrying about potential WDC against them, as the employee’s breach has invalidated their contract and rights to notice. Here, WW best way of proving gross misconduct is through your poor performance in the last two-three years. The tribunal however, are more likely to consider this to be minor misconduct or serious misconduct. They will consider that your poor performance was due to WW breaching your job clause by assigning you duties which were outside of your contract and profession. The tribunal will also consider your strong reputation. <nl><nl>WW may be able to defend your WDC by reversing their decision of you working in accounting and allow you to resume working as a cameraman. You will only be successful in arguing breaches in your contract, if WW did not allow you to work your notice period or they paid you less than the value of your entitled benefits, namely your pension, paid leave, discretionary Christmas bonus and use of Land Rover.<nl><nl>In law, your minimum notice period is implied into your employment contract. The higher notice period indicated in your contract or legislation will prevail. Your contract entitles you to eight weeks’ notice, but law states you are entitled to ten weeks’ notice; as you have worked with WW for ten years. Therefore WW must pay you ten weeks’ worth salary notice, plus monetary value of benefits you would have been entitled to during your notice period. <nl><nl>However, if you choose to evidence your resignation in writing, your resignation will be legal meaning your right to work your notice period will be lost. However WW are legally obliged to fulfil your payment in lieu clause, by paying you monetary value for your company benefits such as paid leave, Christmas bonus, use of Land Rover and Pension scheme. <nl><nl>UDC Prospect <nl>It is unlikely WW will be able to defend your claim, unless they satisfy the tribunal’s requirements arguing they were fair and reasonable in dismissing you for one or more of the five reasons established in law and in doing so, they followed a fair dismissal procedure. Here the burden will be on WW to prove this and must also justify your resignation. If WW are unable to defend your resignation reasons (which I think is likely), you will succeed in arguing WW constructively dismissed you. <nl><nl>Applying this, WW may use ‘other substantial reason,’ ground to defend your dismissal; namely they incurred losses from your projects. Another fair reason WW may use to defend your dismissal may be ‘misconduct,’ regarding your work performance. This is unlikely to succeed, as WW would be required to follow ACAS Disciplinary Guidelines, such as opting for Mediation with you, before dismissing you. As with WDC, the tribunal would require evidence of your work performance from the last two-three years.<nl><nl>Whether you was dismissed withwithout notice, WW must prove they dismissed you following a fair and reasonable dismissal procedure. Here, after orally resigning you have not met with Narinder to further discuss your decision. As the employer, WW should have done this to ensure your dismissal was fair but because they did not, you are likely to be successful in arguing your UDC; as silence from your resignation was a negative response. <nl><nl>What are your options, and what would be the advantages and disadvantages of pursuing each option?<nl>Please find below a list of options available to you. <nl><nl>Option 1: Do not resign and tolerate Narinder’s behaviour.<nl><nl>Advantages:<nl>• You continue to have a regular job and income.<nl>• No stress about finding alternative work.<nl>• Saves time and money, as you will not spend thousands on your legal bill. <nl><nl>Disadvantage:<nl>• Narinder’s disrespectful behaviour may not change.<nl>• The reasonable time for you to resign and argue constructive dismissal from WW will pass. <nl><nl>Option 2: Do not resign, but seek an amicable solution to address Narinder’s behaviour. <nl><nl>Advantages: <nl>• Same as Option 1. <nl>• WW may appreciate your feedback, leading to improvements in Narinder’s behaviour. <nl>• WW may assign you a new line manager. <nl><nl>Disadvantage:<nl>• Same for Option 1, but hopefully this will not happen. <nl><nl>Option 3: Do not resign, but raise a grievance case against Narinder. <nl><nl>Advantages:<nl>• Same as option 2, however WW may consider this to be a drastic measure to take. <nl><nl>Disadvantage:<nl>• Same as Options 1-2. <nl><nl>Option 4: Hand in your notice but do not claim. <nl><nl>Advantages:<nl>• You will be free from Narinder’s treatment. <nl>• You will save time and money in bringing a claim against them.<nl>• You will receive all benefits you are entitled to during your notice period. <nl><nl>Disadvantages:<nl>• You will be unemployed after your notice period.<nl>• Stressful finding another job. <nl><nl>Option 5: Resign and argue constructive dismissal under WDC and UDC.<nl><nl>Advantages:<nl>• You will receive your entitled benefits had you worked your notice period. <nl>• You will feel happy seeing Narinder being disciplined for her behaviour.<nl>• Feel happy seeing WW negative publicity.<nl><nl>Disadvantages:<nl>• Same as Option 4.<nl>• There is no guarantee of winning which may waste your time and money. <nl><nl>I think Option 2 is beneficial to you, however it is your choice. <nl><nl>What remedies might you seek, and, if they include financial compensation, how much -providing figures where possible - is a court or tribunal likely to order Wildlife Wonders to pay out to you, should you succeed with each claim?<nl><nl>WDC<nl>The tribunal may award you financial compensation, an injunction andor declaration that WW wrongfully dismissed you. The tribunal is likely to award you compensation, as this suits your needs better because a declaration will financially damage WW more due to negative publicity. <nl><nl>Your compensation will be depend on if WW allow you to work your notice period or they pay you the monetary value of your entitled benefits instead. The tribunal will order WW to pay you 10 weeks’ worth salary (£10,000), as this is your legal notice period entitlement. This will include your benefits entitlements, namely your pension of approximately £4,000. Your notice will continue throughout the Christmas period, hence the tribunal will order WW to pay you your contractual Christmas Bonus (£1,560). As this is discretionary, the tribunal will order this, if you receive your ‘Christmas [bonus]’ regularly. If so, WW must pay your bonus, as this constitutes an employee contractual ‘right[s] to receive.’ <nl><nl>Currently, you have taken two days’ leave. I doubt you would taken more, during your notice. Legally, employers must compensate employees for untaken leave, because employers have benefitted from extra employee work. Therefore, the tribunal will award you 26 days’ worth salary (£3,703.96). To avoid this, WW may encourage you to take leave during your notice. <nl><nl>Your compensation totals £19,263.96. This includes notice salary (£10,000), Pension (£4,000), untaken leave (£3,703.96) and Christmas bonus (£1,560). Without Christmas bonus your compensation totals £17,703.96. Your desire to keep Land Rover may reduce your compensation. Subtracting the car, your compensation totals £11,763.96 or £10,203.96 without Christmas bonus. When negotiating with WW do not make it obvious you wish to keep the car. Given your strong reputation and to avoid publicity, WW may allow you to keep the car. If your accounting transfer increased your salary, the tribunal will order WW to pay the difference. Your overall compensation is below tribunal’s maximum award of £25,000. I advise you bring your WDC and UDC to a tribunal. <nl><nl>UDC<nl>The tribunal can lawfully re-instate you into your current job, with Narinder continuing as your manager. Or they may re-engage you into your current job, with a new manager and WW branch. The tribunal is unlikely to re-instate or re-engage you, as your relationship with WW is damaged. However, if you wish to be re-instated or re-engaged, the tribunal will consider this. <nl><nl>Your compensation will consist of basic and compensatory awards. <nl>Basic Award <nl>Tribunal will award you £6,300 based on your weekly gross salary (£525 cap), age, and 10 years of service. <nl><nl>Compensatory Award<nl>The maximum tribunal may award is your current gross salary (£78,000), as it is below £86,444 cap. This may be lower (£25,000), as this is fair, equitable; considering time taken to secure another job.<nl><nl>If both claims succeed, the tribunal will only award you compensation for UDC (£84,300) because this includes your salary and benefits lost during your notice. The tribunal may be inclined to reduce your compensation award, as early payments give you investment opportunities, but this is unlikely due to the Coronavirus recession. <nl><nl>Given your strong reputation, skills and compensation award, it is possible for you to create your own business providing you have no competitive restrictive covenants. The tribunal will consider this.  The tribunal will consider your skills, experience and how long it will take you to find another job. If you are currently looking for jobs and havewill attend an interview, please inform me because the tribunal will reimburse your expenses made, namely travel fee and newspapers subscriptions. <nl><nl>Additional information<nl>Please email me your employment contract, as I may identify further benefit entitlements and if WW can allow you to work your notice or pay you in lieu. If not, WW cannot enforce restrictive covenants and other clauses against you; for this invalidates your contract.<nl><nl>Please confirm if you have opted out of Working Time Regulations 1998, as this determines your ability to be compensated for untaken leave. <nl><nl>I leave you to reflect and will contact you for further instructions. <nl><nl>Yours Sincerely, <nl>", "r <addr7_NN>,<nl><nl>I hope you’re well. <nl><nl>I’m in a sticky situation regarding the submission of my <module> Summative. <nl><nl>I have written confirmation from one of my <module> module tutors (<pers_FN>) that this assignment does not require a bibliography.

{"id": "5f49b674-9d8d-46b6-a231-26a30391519b", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Introduction<nl>After winning a costa first novel award, The Shock of the Fall by Nathan Filer (2013) became a piece of popular fiction, inviting a broad range of readers. However, it’s brutal depiction of mental illness means there are differing responses to the text. ‘Reader response data’ has become a popular way for researchers to identify how a reader places themselves in relation to a text through assessing their responses to said text. <nl>This study will assess how reviews from the open access website ‘Good Reads’ align themselves to The Shock of the Fall’s protagonist and overall narrative. Oatley’s (1999) theory of \"identification\" or \"observer\" will be drawn upon for this purpose, as well as Stockwell’s (2009) discussion of reading metaphors, so that commonalities can emerge to determine factors that cause alignment with the text. To compliment these theories, language analysis more generally will be utilised in order to collectively lead to an understanding of reader positioning within the data sets.<nl><nl>Literature Review<nl>The Shock of the Fall by Nathan Filer is a piece of experimental fiction portraying the deteriorating mind of the protagonist, Matthew. McCarthy-Jones (2018) praises Filer for his \"beautiful\" form and word choice, whilst Armstrong (2014, 173) highlights the brilliant use of \"complex narrative structure\" and experimental use of \"graphics and fonts\". Moreover, Armstrong argues that the novel is brilliant both in its insightful portrayal of the family bond, but also in its depictions of mental health. Similarly, Rajasingam (2014) believes the novel depicts the inpatient experience with such accuracy that it could be beneficial for junior doctors to understand the bleak realities of these unique situations. This accurate depiction is most likely down to Filer’s personal experience as a psychiatric nurse (Sanai 2014), as he was seemingly able to amalgamate his previous experience to create the protagonist, Matthew.<nl>This study utilises reader response data. Reader response data is seen as a \"rigorous and evidence based\" approach to understanding reader interactions with a text (Whiteley and Canning 2017). Fish (1970) discusses how a text comes into being through reader interaction. Therefore, reader response data allows us to seek, understand and interpret reader’s interactions with certain texts through different means, which is why it is utilised within this research to determine factors of alignment within reader reviews. <nl>The basis of this research surrounds Oatley’s (1995;1999) theory discussing alignment with a text. Oatley (1999) argues there are two positions a reader adopts; \"identification\" or \"observer\". He believes that the observer is a spectator role, in which we are an objective outsider in a narrative, whereas identification occurs when a reader aligns themselves with the protagonist, taking on their goals and emotions. Moreover, he argues that a first-person narrative favours identification, whereas third-person narratives favour the spectatorobserver role. Identification is therefore seen as an intense alignment with the protagonist, with Oatley stating we \"become that person\" in the narrative (Oatley 1999, 446), made ever more present if the reader can sympathise with the protagonist through personal experience (Oatley 1995). However, it is important to note that these alignments are part of a scale where readers have autonomy, as opposed to having a fixed state in one position.  <nl>To analyse the position of identification or observer, one of the methods I will be using is metaphor analysis. Lakoff and Johnson’s (1980) ‘conceptual metaphor theory’ highlights how we better understand an entity when it is described in relation to another. It shows how metaphors can be \"extended\", allowing us to map the meaning within a metaphor in order to gauge the full detail of the comparison. Dirven et al (2003) highlight the significance of the theory, arguing conceptual metaphor theory ignited the importance of metaphor for our understanding of knowledge. Metaphors are useful in conjunction with noticing the identifierobserver role, as the way a reader discusses their experience of reading is often linked to their level of submersion and alignment with the protagonist and the text. <nl>Stockwell (2009) and Gerrig (1993) discuss metaphors more centred around reading. Stockwell (extending knowledge outlined by Gerrig) discusses metaphors that can be used by readers to describe their reading experience. These include \"reading is a journey\", \"reading as transport\" and \"reading as control\" (Stockwell 2009, 80-81). Stockwell (2005, 144) believes critical theorists should \"engage with the texture of the text\", which allows us to read as one does when they are simply reading for enjoyment; a \"natural reader\". With ‘Good Reads’ being a platform for mostly natural readers, we can see how utilising this method will allow inferences for reader position to emerge, as the reviewers discuss their experiences in a natural way, therefore giving their natural alignment with the text. <nl>I will also be drawing on conceptions of ‘stake inoculation’ and ‘category entitlement’ within my analysis. Stake inoculation can be identified when a reader is not presenting a vested interest in a text, and has been described as readers wanting to be \"regarded as considered, reasoned and neutral\" (Peplow 2011, 306). Category entitlement, however, is defined as when certain people in specific situations are given authority for their knowledge in a specific area (Potter 1996). These features can be linked to the need to keep a \"positive face\" that is protected and maintained with the social space (Potter 1996; Goffman 1967). Reviewers may use stake inoculation andor category entitlement in order to portray themselves in a positive light for other reviewers, especially because the site is seen as a \"social network for book reviews\" (Fay 2012). <nl><nl>Methodology<nl>I began my naturalistic study by sourcing reviews from the open access website ‘Good Reads’; a book reviewing website. This website was useful as it allows users to interact with reviews through ‘likes’, as well as having a rating system (one to five stars) to review the book discussed. As a result, I was able to find the most ‘liked’ reviews within each rating category. By choosing the most ‘liked’ reviews, the assumption can be made that the views described within the review reflect the majority, as they were the most widely interacted with. <nl>After selecting the most liked review from each rating category, I anonymised each review, by naming them R1 (being the review with a one-star rating) to R5 (being the review with a five-star rating), ensuring no ethical issues in relation to confidentiality could occur (See Appendix for full reviews). I then used ‘NVivo’; a form of qualitative data analysis software, to begin my analysis. I ‘coded’ each review in NVivo, which then highlighted areas where there were common themes among each review. This allowed me to make inferences as to the common themes that link to identificationobservation (Oatley 1999) within each of the rating categories. <nl><nl>Analysis<nl>Comparing uses of Category Entitlement:<nl>One of the most common themes across all of the reviews is category entitlement. All of the reviewers, in one way or another, highlighted their authority within their review. The interesting part about comparing the uses of category entitlement is the difference in tone that occurs depending on how positive or negative the review is. The more negative reviews use this device in order to depict how The Shock of The Fall was a bad novel, because they identified better with certain other novels (R1 and R2). Whereas, the more positive reviews show their identification with The Shock of The Fall by providing examples of other mental health literature that has also made them feel this way (R3, R4 and R5). For example, R5 states they have read \"a number of books regarding mental illness\", but describes this text as \"purely unique\". On the other hand, R1 argues \"I would never recommend this book considering the wealth of options available to readers […]\". Peplow et al (2015, 75) discuss how you can put yourself forward as having \"expert knowledge\", which can be seen through the intentional discussion of broader knowledge. However, they also discuss how readers can \"play down\" their entitlement, which is also present through the subtle portrayals of wider reading as opposed to more direct mentions of expert knowledge (Peplow et al 2015, 74). As ‘Good Reads’ is a platform that invites avid readers, one could argue that a participant of the site would likely house a level of category entitlement simply due to this fact, and therefore their broad knowledge of literature would most likely be conveyed within their reviews, intentionally or not. Moreover, the fact that the website has open access means some reviewers may want to portray, and maintain, a ‘positive face’ (Potter 1996; Goffman 1967), which can be achieved through the use of category entitlement. Therefore, the comparative aspect category entitlement allows the users to present their identificationobservation with the text.<nl>Although in another breadth of mental illness, a study into the effects of reading novels about eating disorders showed participants felt their mood and self-confidence diminished, whilst other genres improved their mood (Troscianko 2018). Despite being about a very different aspect of mental health, I believe these findings highlight how the genre one chooses to focus on can have such ingrained effects on themselves as a reader. In a similar way to Oatley’s (1995) statement about how a reader identifies more intensely if they can empathise with a reader from their personal experience, you could argue that reading fiction of this genre highlights how different forms of mental health literature ignite different reactions for certain individuals. Where the more positive reviews name novels that depict mental health in a way that has \"fascinated\" them (R4) and highlight their appreciation for such literature (R5, R3), the more negative reviews could arguably be having a similar reaction to that laid out in the study mentioned (Troscianko 2018) through their preference of other mental health literature (R2), therefore showing the use of comparison to determine alignment with the text. As the readers all portray themselves to have a broad knowledge of literature, we can see how a novel of such unique nature could create conflicting responses depending on the reviewers individual understanding and perceptions of mental health literature more generally. Therefore, we can see that all of the reviews utilise category entitlement as a device to compare The Shock of the Fall to other texts of a similar vein, which therefore portrays their level of observationidentification depending on how they ‘rank’ this text compared to others they discuss. <nl>Emotive vs Clinical Language – Comparing uses of Reading Metaphors and Stake Inoculation:<nl>Reading metaphors (Stockwell 2009; Gerrig 1993) are an insightful way to decipher the identificationobserver positioning. Stockwell (2009,80) identifies a number of metaphors commonly used by readers; reading is \"transport\", reading is \"control\", and reading is \"investment\". As these responses can be aligned more directly with an investment with the reading material, it isn’t entirely unsurprising that the two top rated reviews are the only reviews which give examples of this use of metaphor. The more positive reviews actively present themselves as having an identification stance through their use of reading metaphors. R5 described being \"grabbed\" and \"held\" by the book, providing an example of the \"reading as control\" metaphor that Stockwell (2009, 80) discusses. As this is the most highly rated review, which speaks very positively about the novel as a whole, is it not surprising that the reader feels so invested in the narrative. However, despite R4 being mostly positive, the metaphors used within their review do not reflect their identification in the same way. R4 utilises \"reading as transport\" (Stockwell 2009, 80) through feelings of being lost in the narrative; \"at times you have to try and remember where you are\", as well as describing the narrative as \"following\" the narrator. Here, the use of metaphor seems to have less intensity; they are not being controlled in the same sense that R5 describes. However, there is still a clear alignment presented, as the reviewer is situated within the narrative for the feeling of being \"lost\" to occur. Although \"following\" for R4 is not as intense of a description as \"grabbed\" and \"held\" in R5, we can see that there is still a level of alignment that is arguably understandable from their different review ratings (as R4 rated the novel slightly lower than R5). Their difference also highlights Oatley’s argument that aligning with a text is part of a scale, therefore R4 simply isn’t as far on the ‘identification scale’ as R5. Therefore, we can see that the use of metaphor for the more positive reviews shows the level of identification that the readers feel through their embodiment of the text. <nl>On the other hand, it is interesting how some of the negative reviews use stake inoculation, which directly contrasts the intense feeling described by the reading metaphors portrayed in the positive reviews. Where the positive reviewers use metaphor in order to portray an alignment with the text, R3 and R2 speak about the same harrowing events within the novel, yet do not use the same language to describe the experience. R2 states very blatantly \"Matt is haunted by his dead brother\", whilst R3 states \"This is an interesting read that deals with mental illness, more particularly schizophrenia, as a result of a boy’s grief over the death of his older brother.\". Where other more positive reviews have discussed the physical grip and transportation that the portrayal of the protagonist’s mental health had on them, we can see with R2 and R3 that there is a very clinical, blunt approach to discussing the topic. Stake inoculation is about a portrayal of being \"considered, reasoned and neutral\" (Peplow 2011, 306), which, when discussing mental health, shows why some who wish to portray themselves in this way would use such clinical language to describe the text. Peplow (2011) discusses how a reader’s positive face can be at risk if they engage in explaining their personal interpretation of a text due to judgement from other readers, therefore this could indicate why some of the reviewers, on a site that is based so largely on user interaction, could use stake inoculation as a means to deter this judgement. <nl>The stark comparison between the positive and negative reviews shows how having an identification stance clearly impacts your perception of a text, as those that do identify describe their reading experience with so much more intensity. On the other hand, the clinical approach of the negative reviews highlights that they simply observed the events without gaining any form of attachment to the protagonist or his struggles, giving a fairly alternate reading experience. <nl>Perceptions of Accuracy:<nl>The majority of the reviews comment on Filer’s accurate depiction of mental health within the novel, arguing his background as a psychiatric nurse enhanced his ability to portray expert knowledge on the topic. Therefore, we can see, even within the negative reviews, one of the main praises is through this depiction of accuracy. However, the important distinction between the positive and negative reviews, despite all of them praising the accurate depiction, is that some reviews can empathise with the accurate depiction, whereas others can simply appreciate. The most negative review, R1, states their appreciation for the accuracy very blatantly; \"…it presents a very realistic glimpse of what mental illness looks and feels like\". Here we see no language that attaches the reader to the narrative; they are embodying the essence of an observer role. R2 is less clinical in language, yet still places themselves outside of the story world; \"You do get a very strong sense of the mental bind that some patients… get into once they’re sucked into the mental health biz…\". R2 is very informal throughout, therefore their discussion of the accuracy continues this informal language to convey their observer position. This review uses emotive language to describe the actual events of the novel (\"mental bind\", \"sucked into\"), but this language is solely attached to the narrative and not their emotions in relation to said narrative. Similar to the use of stake inoculation discussed previously, the clinical language is used within the more negative reviews as a means to distance themselves from the narrative. Therefore, we can see that again, with such a sensitive topic, the clinical language allows these reviewers to avoid being seen as prejudice (Peplow 2011) by simply outlining events as opposed to exposing their own opinions of said events.<nl>On the other hand, with the more positive reviews, the accuracy only seemed to add to their levels of identification. R5 states \"He [Filer] does not idealise the staff or the patients, both of them have good days and bad days and this was remarkably refreshing.\". Moreover, R3 states \"It is a daring but successful endeavour on the part of the author to unravel the tangled world a person with schizophrenia lives in.\". Here, we can see that identificationobservation is part of a scale, as both the most highly rated review and the neutral review use emotive language which signifies identification. R3’s use of emotive language (\"daring\", \"unravel\", \"tangled\") in isolation invite the assumption of heightened identification, but when we assess within the entire review, this isn’t the case. Whereas R5 discusses the accuracy in the expected manner due to their consistent identification. Oatley (1999) believes first-person narratives invite more of an \"identification\" role, which is reflected within these reviews. Those that do identify can be seen to enter the story world and therefore take on the emotions of the protagonist, meaning the accurate depiction seemingly made this embodiment even more intense. Moreover, Oatley (1995) argues that emotions arise whenif a reader can empathise with the story characters and their struggles, particularly from personal experience, which could indicate why some reviews discuss the text with such identification; if a reader has had personal experiences that are similar to the protagonist, they may be able to identify more heavily than someone who cannot relate in the same way. <nl>When we assess the discussion of accuracy from all of the reviewers, we can see that accuracy as a feature within a novel does not create a heightened level of observation or identification, but instead can be analysed as a discussion point to assess the position of observationidentification. In other words, in some cases it is important to see how readers discuss aspects of a text, as opposed to the specific aspect itself. With this example, language analysis is the focal device to understand the identificationobserver role, as well as highlighting how alignment with a text causes fairly distinctive differences in perceptions of key themes. <nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>Despite using a small data set, I believe there is clear evidence about the factors that indicate the identificationobserver role in relation to The Shock of the Fall, and therefore the aim of this research has been met. It emerged that the positive reviews had identification with the text (seen through emotive language and use of metaphor), and the negative reviews were more observational (seen through stake inoculation and clinical language). However, the slight inconsistencies of these patterns highlight Oatley’s argument that identificationobservation is part of a scale as opposed to two polarised positions. Should this research be extended with a larger data set, I believe more evidence would arise to reflect this scale, and present that not all negative reviews are entirely observational, and not all positive reviews show identification. <nl>It seems the best device to assess the identificationobservation within the reviews was language analysis. The comparison between the different reviews showed that it isn’t necessarily the presence of certain linguistic factors (for example category entitlement), but the discussion of such that show reader positioning; language analysis shows the device as an entity does not lead to an understanding of reader position, but the way it is utilised does. <nl>", " that's fine.

Creative solutions must be novel and acknowledged by society. The study of creativity consists of the 4 p’s which focuses either on, creative people, creative processes, products of creativity and creative places (environment).<nl>According to the psychometric approach, participants are tested using mental tests for direct measurements. However, such tests often confound intelligence and creativity, because not all creative people are high in IQ. Supporting this theory, Guilford (1956) distinguished between convergent and divergent thinking. He proposed that convergent thinkers find one best solution to a problem whereas, divergent thinkers can lead to many solutions to the same problem. He concluded that, creativity is a form of divergent thinking, because it brings many unrelated ideas together, also known as insight. Therefore, creativity makes use of methods which test divergent thinking such as the \"unusual uses test\" by J.P. Guilford (1967). Although divergent creativity tests are time consuming, they provide accurate measures of creativity than convergence.<nl>Creative Insight can occur in three ways (Sternberg and Davidson, 1982). Firstly, selective encoding refers to most important information being extracted from what is available. Secondly, selective combination is known to be the best way of combining information is perceived. Lastly, selectively comparison, whereby the information for the current problem being solved is related by analogy to a similar problem in one’s past, which often uses mental images (Shepard 1978). Utilising these steps, creativity can be made easier to obtain. <nl>The biographic and autographic approach for creativity is idiosyncratic and makes major use of peer judgments.

{"id": "b3a04a4d-a501-4b8a-bd94-72943a8ed92d", "discourse_types": ["essay", "text_message"], "pair": ["The question to what extent to which English Laws general hostility towards good faith in commercial contracts is justifiable within the modern day has been subjected to disapproval by some judges. In Interfoto Picture Library Ltd v Stiletto Visual Programmes Ltd Bingham L.J. noted that ‘in many legal systems outside the common law world, the law of obligations recognises and enforces an overriding principle that in making and carrying out contracts parties should act in good faith’ but English law has decided not to adopt a good faith obligation but rather ‘developed piecemeal solutions in response to demonstrated problems of unfairness.’ The courts in England are more concerned with commercial certainty rather than parties being just towards one another. <nl><nl>This essay will argue that the hostility towards good faith obligations within commercial contracts cannot be justified in the modern day and that there should be a good faith principle introduced in English Law. It will begin by discussing the current law in relation to good faith and explain how an overriding principle of good faith will be beneficial to the parties in commercial contracts. It will then suggest the reasons why in this day and age it is important for there to be an obligation of good faith within commercial contracts and give examples of the English law’s current recognition of implied and express good faith obligations. Finally, it will look at the general principles of the UK courts such as party autonomy and commercial certainty and explore how they can still be preserved with an obligation of good faith. <nl><nl>Good faith is the notion that those within contracts will act fairly towards one another. They will ‘put all their cards face upwards on the table’ and trade in a way that is open and fair.<nl>Traditionally good faith is not an overriding principle in English Law as the courts prefer for there to be certainty within commercial contracts as opposed to fairness. They are particularly against imposing broad good faith obligations. The reasons for this include the fact that it can cause uncertainty because if there was an obligation to act in good faith this can sometimes go against what the terms of the contract include. The parties can usually only go to court if one party does not fulfil their end of the contract. Furthermore, good faith can be seen as subjective as every person will have a different view of what good faith is and sometimes one judge may go too far and start siding with one party which would cause the other party a loss and so it would be difficult to find a middle point where it is suitable for both parties to not be at a complete loss. Another reason as to why the English courts prefer not to have a good faith obligation is because it makes them a lot more attractive to global businesses since they are one of the main countries without a good faith obligation. This allows for those wanting to get into commercial contracts to be more certain about the outcomes if anything was to go wrong. English law also prefers for there to be party autonomy as it allows both parties to be able to choose which law will govern their contract.  This allows for an enhanced level of certainty and predictability because both parties will be able to choose which laws best suit them. The parties also have freedom of contract which gives each party the freedom to enter into a contract and decide what terms to include. <nl><nl>Rather than an actual good faith principal English law prefers to adopt piecemeal solutions which are used for certain situations where it is seen as necessary. These will usually arise in fiduciary relationships, contracts of insurance and contracts of partnerships and employment. These include contractual interpretation where the courts will look at the intention of the parties rather than a strict interpretation of the words used in the contract.  Another instance where the courts might decide to use piecemeal solutions is when an unfair act amounts to promissory estoppel. Misrepresentation is another example where the courts might use piecemeal solutions. In some contracts such as ones where fiduciary duties are assumed there is a duty to consider the other party’s interests. The party assuming the fiduciary duties will be obligated to not act dishonestly and cannot allow their interests to clash with those of their principle.  <nl><nl>Within the terms of a contract a party is allowed to include an express term to act or negotiate in good faith. This will mean both parties will have to act and negotiate in good faith and the courts will uphold this term as it is written in the contract if it is breached by either party. In Berkeley Community Villages Ltd v Pullen, it was held that an agreement would be enough to create a contractual obligation for the parties to act in good faith. This approach was also used in CPC Group Ltd v Qatari Diar Real Estate Investment Co by Vos J. who stated that ‘the obligation of utmost good faith in the [contract]was to adhere to the spirit of the contract …. And to observe reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing, in the shortest possible time, and to be faithful to the agreed common purpose, and to act consistently with the justified expectations of the parties.’ There is an increased amount of recognition for express terms to act in good faith in commercial contracts and many judges will uphold the term because their concern is ensuring the terms of the contract are not breached. This means that if a party wants a good faith obligation in their contract then they just have to include one as a term of the contract but if the other party does not want a goof faith obligation imposed on them then it can cause some issues for the parties as it could be assumed that the other party may not have the intention to act fairly and that is the reason why they don’t want a good faith obligation in the contract. However, if there was a good faith obligation then this would ensure that both the parties have to act fairly towards one another which would almost eliminate the party’s having bad intentions entering the contract as they know if they act upon their bad intentions then they will have to face the consequences in court. In the past there has been attempts by judges to introduce a good faith principle that extends to all contracts. In 1766 Lord Mansfield declared that ‘[t]he governing principle is applicable to all contracts and dealings. Good faith forbids either party by concealing what he privately knows, to draw the other into a bargain, from his ignorance of that fact, and his believing the contrary. But either party may be innocently silent, as to grounds open to both, to exercise their judgment upon.’ However this outlook did not last long as the courts favoured party autonomy and sanctity of contract more.  It is useful for parties to have an express term to act in good faith in their contract as it would allow them to resolve a problem that might happen in the future using a good faith mechanism rather than use an expensive third-party tool. Having an express term to negotiate or act in good faith will allow parties to plan ahead in the event of an uncontrollable event happening such as the market crashing or an economic recession. In the event this does happen the parties will be able to discuss how they can continue to keep working with each other and how they will uphold their side of the agreement. It is becoming very common to find good faith clauses within contracts in the modern day which suggests that many people want to trade in good faith and would not be opposed to a good faith obligation as a lot of those in commercial contracts have willingly decided to include a good faith clause in their contracts. <nl><nl>Good faith may sometimes be implied by law in certain contracts as a term that must be followed. It is often needed in order for the contract to run smoothly. It is not implied based upon the intentions of the parties, rather because of the contractual relationship between the two parties.The different types of contracts it can be implied in include employment contracts, contracts of sale and goodwill as well as partnerships and contracts with fiduciary duties. Another way good faith can be implied is through fact. This is done to give importance to the intention of the parties in the contract. It is often implied based on necessity and obviousness. The case of Yam Seng Pte v International Trade Corp Ltd was significant in discussing whether there was an implied obligation that both parties will act in good faith with each other. Lord Leggart J. had agreed that the terms in the contract were enough to imply good faith and he also argued in favour of ‘the implication of a term requiring good faith in performance’ not only in just relational contracts but most commercial contracts based on the expectations of both parties. The fact that English law already has many instances where it uses pockets of good faith proves that a good faith principle would prove to be useful for parties entering into a contract as it is already used in several types of contracts and contractual relations. Many other countries such as the United States of America, Canada and Australia have a good faith principle in place which means that it is possible for the United Kingdom to have one too without the worry of wondering how they will execute such a principle. Although, the English courts might argue that having an obligation of good faith will take away from the party’s freedom of contract and party autonomy, this can be disputed with the fact that the Canadian Supreme Court has said ‘the principle of good faith must be applied in a manner that is consistent with the fundamental commitments of the common law of contract which generally places great weight on the freedom of contracting parties to pursue their individual self-interest.’ The English courts can follow a similar approach and apply the principle in a way that will still allow those in commercial contracts their contractual freedom whilst also ensuring that they deal in a way that is honest, fair and truthful to the other party. <nl><nl>The introduction of a good faith obligation will allow parties to feel more reassured that if the other party was to act in bad faith towards them, then they will at least have support from the courts. The party who acted in bad faith would be required to give compensation to the other party in order to correct their wrongdoings. The English courts are already accepting of a good faith clause within contracts and also state that there is a duty to act in good faith in certain types of relationships. This suggests that they may be open to the idea of introducing a legally binding principle of good faith. The law has developed in regard to express terms to negotiate in good faith since the case of Walford v Miles where the House of Lords had stated that promises to negotiate or not sell were unenforceable and rejected that the opposing party were under an obligation to act in good faith. Lord Acknew has stated that ‘a bare agreement to negotiate was not enforceable, as it lacked the necessary certainty.  It was no more than an (unenforceable) ‘agreement to agree’. However, in Petromec Inc v Petroleo Brasileiro SA Petrobras it was held that if there was an express term to negotiate in good faith then it is enforceable. Whilst Longmore LJ had expressed that there were three objections to negotiate in good faith, he also stated that these objections did not completely prevent enforceability. He claimed that the first objection had carried little weight because normally the express obligation would have been enforceable. The second objection would be difficult to determine as it is unlikely the courts will be able to decide when the breach of the term had amounted to good faith and unless fraud was involved then it is likely the court would not consider the other party had acted in bad faith. In regard to the third objection Longmore LJ stated it would be difficult to find out exactly how much loss had occurred as a result of the breach. The development in the law after both of these cases suggests that judges are more accepting of good faith clauses and they are not seen as unenforceable ‘agreements to agree’. The general view of judges in recent times agree with Longmore LJ and believe it would be ‘quite wrong’ for the courts to deem an express clause to negotiate in good faith as unenforceable. <nl><nl>It can be argued that introducing a good faith principle will undermine party autonomy and freedom of contract, but this can be easily resolved by using a method of enforcement similar to Canada when it comes to good faith. If the English courts enforce good faith, then they should limit the amount they get involved in order to preserve the freedom of parties. If the courts introduce a good faith clause then it should be ‘capable of being given legal content’. A good faith obligation would lead to fair dealing and less attempts of people acting in bad faith towards others. It would allow for more trust between parties as they will have more hope that it is unlikely the other party will act unfairly and unjustly towards them. <nl><nl>In conclusion there should be a good faith principle introduced in English law as it will reassure those entering commercial contracts that if they were to enter a contract then the other party will have to act towards them in good faith and trade fairly with them. Parties can also be reassured that the courts would help them if the other party acted in bad faith towards them. There is also an increase in the amount of people in commercial contracts including clauses to act or negotiate in good faith towards one another. This proves that many people are going out of their way to include these clauses as it can be seen as a form of protection. Many international courts have a good faith obligation in place, and it does not take away from the freedom parties have, rather it enhances their security and lessens the chances of them being scammed. This is because the other party will less likely want to act in bad faith if they know the implications of their actions if taken to court. Whilst it is likely the courts will have some reservations or concerns towards a good faith obligation; they can look at how international courts implement the obligation. This will help them to keep a balance between doing too much or too little whilst maintaining the general principles of English commercial law.", "as going to hold them for half a year but like i said if they spike quickly to like 45 bb and 50+ pltr i might sell<new>Even 40 bb<new>Depends how nice pl looks<new>Oke<new>Would be £1000 profit altogether<new>About 950<new>Id probably sell before them tbh<new>That would double my portfolio lol<new>Id be at like 1.6k<new>Hopefully it even reaches 40<new>And pltr highest was 42 so 50 is manageable<new>So damm illegal<new>On bb theyve legit reversed price back to 2 days ago<new>Holy cow 143<new>😂😂😂😂😂<new>Lmfao the worlds markets are broken this week<new>Th head honcho gme man"]}

Hotel U14 Autograph Collection (Unioninkatu 14) - this offers a room with an extra large double bed within a mile from the city centre and 0.8 miles of the beach for £308 (for both nights). This hotel looks very contemporary and also benefits from facilities including fitness centre and a restaurant. 2. Forenom Serviced Apartments (Kristianinkatu 11-13) - this offers a studio with two twin beds within a mile of the city centre and near the water also for £250 (for both nights). This option appears significantly more basic but would offer more independence as is self accommodating if that is what you wish for. - My research shows the Cafeteria Roastery (Runeberginkatu 31) to be the top rated breakfast cafe in the city centre so this would be my recommendation for breakfast. However, if staying at Hotel U14, there is an option to add breakfast for an extra £16 per night (totalling £342). - With regards to leisure activities for you to do in your free time during the trip, there is the Helsinki City Museum (Aleksanterinkatu 16) where you could get an insight into the history of the city, as well as the Apollo Live Club (Mannerheimintie 16) which has live music and comedic acts on Fridays and Saturdays. Both of which are reasonably priced and align with your interests. - There are countless restaurants in the city centre which would offer a variety of traditional cuisine (not involving sea food), though my recommendation would be Ravintola (Kasarmikatu 26) as this appears to offer a combination of fine dining with the traditional cuisine. - Finally there are a couple of large souvenir shops in the centre which would be perfect for you to get your children Finish souvenirs. My recommendations would be either Shop Helsinki-Mikebon (Simonkatu 9) or Kankurin Tapa (Phojoiseplanadi 35) which would be closer to your hotel. I am yet to book any of the above for your stay. If you could please review my recommendations and let me know if you think they are appropriate so that I can pass them onto the travel department to do the booking. Please let me know if you have any questions or would like any further recommendations or changes to your itinerary.", "ish I could remember what she said about her now!

{"id": "15777bdc-a219-42ce-9ba3-9b7965382b05", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Abstract: <nl>This report goes into detail about a study which investigated the type of personality that an individual has whether that is openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism (OCEAN) and how it affects the health of an individual from bad eating habits to lifelong illness. The predictions overall were all as expected, that certain personality types have different eating habits. The major findings of the results were the participants overall do not have unhealthy eating behaviours and habits. It could be said that the predictor values have a weak correlational relationship with the FFQ scores, in addition to this the result also show that the personality factors have negative correlations with the FFQ score apart from neuroticism. <nl>Introduction: <nl>Personality as said by Allport in 1961 is a dynamic organisation in an individual of psychophysical systems that create the characteristics, behaviour, thoughts and feelings of a person (Carducci, 2009). Many researchers have looked into the relationship between health and personality and have found that there could be a correlation between them therefore it is important to study more about the topic. Furthermore, by finding out about the correlation between an individual’s personality and eating behaviour it could aid the public health sector. If psychologist are able to develop theories based on the personality types of an individual linked to their eating habits which may be causing them health complications, then individuals may be able to better their health and reduce their issues from the advice they get due to research from psychologist. The widely accepted structure of personality is the ‘Big 5’ which is the five-factor model test. This is a self-report test that measures the big five personality traits, openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism (OCEAN) where individuals have to see how they score by rating each statement regarding how well it describes themselves. After completing this test, the individual can see how their personality traits are and how it may affect their day to day life (Raad &amp; Perugini , 2002).<nl>Predictions:<nl>Based on previous research done by Lunn et al in 2014 it would be correct to predict that individuals with more increased openness will have a negative correlation with an unhealthy diet would be present.  Furthermore, participants with a high conscientiousness  reflect self- discipline and determination, therefore, are also likely to have a general healthy diet therefore it would be right to say that a negative correlation with an unhealthy diet could be predicted. In addition to this, Wicki in 2010 found that stimulation seeking could explain the association between extraversion with alcohol consumption this means they could be prone to bad eating habits. Therefore, extraversion could be positively correlated with an unhealthy diet. Similar to this studies have shown that an individual with more neuroticism could be reliant on bad eating habits and prone to bad health and this is due to their general tension and negative emotions, so they use it to cope. Therefore, it could be predicted that individuals with high neuroticism will have a positive correlation with an unhealthy diet. Lastly, agreeableness needs further investigations, but the prediction could be that they could have a negative correlation with an unhealthy diet, because they are mostly positive and have a positive mindset and therefore this could also lead to a healthier life and healthier mind(Johansen, 2018).<nl><nl>Method<nl>Design:<nl>For this study the independent variable was the personality traits that the participants were being tested on called OCEAN- openness, conscientious, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism. A within subjects’ design was used as the participants are answering all of the independent variables on the questionnaire. The dependant variable in this study was the FFQ scores that the participants scored on the test, in this case it would be the unhealthy eating  score. <nl>Participants:<nl>Within this study 195 participants were used from the general population and were aged between 15 and 73 years old (n=195). The participants consisted of both females and males. <nl>Materials:<nl>All participants were given a questionnaire sheet to complete along with a pen. The items used in the FFQ and BFI, the BFI scoring technique can be found in the Hartmann and Johns paper.<nl>Procedure:<nl>For this study firstly informed consent was taken and the participants were aware that they had the right to withdraw at any time during the study. All participants were given the questionnaire to complete within an hour and were told to put a number next to all the statements in the questionnaire. They were asked to answer as honestly as they could and following this all of the questionnaires had their results taken in and were analysed.<nl>Results: <nl><table><nl>From the table you are able to see that the figures for the standardized B are low digits. The correlation is not significant. <nl><table><nl>Discussion:<nl>From the table above you are able to see  correlation did not show a significant association between the personality and health. It could be said that the predictor values have a weak correlational relationship with the FFQ scores, in addition to this the result also show that the personality factors have negative correlations with the FFQ score apart from neuroticism. In addition to this, the descriptive statistics show that the minimum score of the FFQ was 1.50 and the maximum score for the FFQ score was 111.50, which is a large range. Lastly this caused the mean to equal 21.7 and therefore that concludes that the participants overall do not have unhealthy eating behaviours and habits.<nl>These results are what the predictions stated earlier on in the report, e.g. it was predicted that the participants with a high neuroticism FFQ score will have a positive correlation with bad and unhealthy eating habits and this could be due to the fact that they are prone to bad eating habits as a way of coping with their stress. Individuals with the conscientiousness score showed that it was a predictor.<nl>In addition to this, there are logical explanations as to why the study proved the predictions. Firstly, it could be because normally self- report methods are bias on behalf of the participants as they may want to seem and come across better than they actually are, which is known as social desirability bias. In this case, it would have been expected that the participants were giving more desirable answers, and this led to \"healthier\" individuals. This also proves that previous research is accurate. Due to these results it is evident that the correlational study is reliable and holds high validity.", " I was wondering how I would be able to change the email that I had used for <system>, and redirect it to use this email instead.

A growing body of evidence suggests that personality traits may make an individual more susceptible to unhealthy eating habits. A personality trait reflects a person’s characteristic pattern of thinking, feeling and behaving (Soto, 2018). According to the Five Factor Model of personality, there are five major trait dimensions: openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism (OCEAN), also known as the Big Five (Costa &amp; McCrae, 1992).<nl>Of the five traits, high neuroticism and low conscientiousness have been consistently associated with unhealthy eating behaviours (UEBs). For instance, highly neurotic individuals tend to consume more sweet, savoury and convenience foods (Keller &amp; Siegrist, 2015) and higher intakes of sugar and fats (Tiainen, et al., 2013). Individuals low in conscientiousness struggle controlling their impulses to eat unhealthy food over a healthier alternative (Elfhag &amp; Morey, 2008). Low conscientiousness has also been found to predict the consumption of foods indicative of an unhealthy diet (Keller &amp; Siegrist, 2015).<nl>Based on previous findings, it is hypothesised that there will be a significant positive correlation between neuroticism and UEBs, a significant negative correlation between conscientiousness and UEBs, and no significant relationship between openness to experience, extraversion or agreeableness and UEBs. Simply put, individuals high in neuroticism and low in conscientiousness will demonstrate more unhealthy eating habits.<nl>Method<nl>Participants<nl>A sample of 195 participants was recruited using an opportunity sample. Participants included 135 females (69.2%) and 60 males (30.8%) aged between 15 and 73 years (M = 26.6, SD = 13.1).<nl>Design<nl>A correlational design was used. The predictor variables were Big Five personality traits (with five levels: openness to experience, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness and neuroticism). The dependent variable was food frequency questionnaire scores.<nl>Materials<nl>Big Five Inventory (BFI). Personality was measured using the Big Five Inventory (BFI; John, Naumann, &amp; Soto, 2008). The BFI is a 44-item, self-report questionnaire that is divided into subscales for each of the Big Five factors of personality (see Appendix A. The inventory consists of 44 brief statements (e.g. ‘I see myself as someone who is talkative’) that are rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (‘strongly disagree’) to 5 (‘strongly agree’). A mean score for each subscale was calculated and some of the items were reverse-scored. The BFI presents an average Cronbach’s alpha of .83 and average test-retest reliability of .85 (John &amp; Srivastava, 1999). <nl>Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ). Food consumption was assessed using the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ; Hartmann, Siegrist, &amp; van der Horst, 2012). The FFQ is a self adminstered, 182-item questionnaire grouped into four different categories; sweets and savouries, sugar-sweetened beverages, meat and convenience foods (see Appendix B). The fruit and vegatable category was excluded, as the present study focused on UEBs. These food groups were chosen because their excessive consumption had been shown to cause serious health problems. Participants were asked to report how often they consumed each item. Items relating to sweets and savouries, sugar-sweetened beverages and meat consumption were assessed on a 6-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (‘never’) to 14 (‘several times per day’). Items relating to convenience food consumption were assessed on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (‘never’) to 7 (‘daily’). Cronbach’s α was 0.71 for sweets and savouries, 0.69 for sugar-sweetened drinks, 0.69 for meat and 0.71 for convenience foods. Items falling into each food group were summed to reflect consumption frequency of these foods per week.<nl>Procedure<nl>An online questionnaire was created using 44 items from the BFI and 182 items from the FFQ. After providing informed consent, participants were sent an email containing the link to a Google Forms survey. The survey consisted of three separate sections: demographics (gender, age), BFI and FFQ. Upon completion, participants were presented with a debrief page. The raw data set was retrieved from Google Forms as an Excel file. Then, the raw scores were converted into mean scores for the BFI and total scores for the FFQ. For the BFI, negatively keyed items were reverse scored to ensure respondents were providing consistent answers. Items were then coded to the appropriate subscales. A mean score between 1 and 5 was calculated for each BFI trait, by adding up the scores and dividing them by the number of items within that trait. The final data set of demographics, personality traits and eating behaviours was exported to Jamovi (The Jamovi Project, 2021) for analysis. <nl>Statistical analysis<nl>Pearson correlation was used to test the relationship between the Big Five traits and UEBs. Then, a multiple linear regression was performed to explore which personality traits were the best predictors for UEBs. The predictor variables that were hypothesised to be significant predictors were entered into the regression, i.e. conscientiousness and neuroticism.<nl>Results<nl><nl><table><nl>Table 1 shows that agreeableness had the highest mean score, while neuroticism had the lowest mean score as well as the highest variation. As the highest possible FFQ score was 182, the mean FFQ score suggests that overall, the sample was health conscious.<nl>Inferential statistics<nl><table><nl>As shown in Table 2, there was a weak negative and statistically significant correlation between conscientiousness and FFQ score. No significant correlation was observed between neuroticism and FFQ score. Low conscientiousness and agreeableness, as well as high neuroticism, were more prominent in younger participants. Higher FFQ scores were also more common in younger participants.<nl><table><nl>A multiple linear regression was performed to test whether conscientiousness and neuroticism signficantly predicted UEBs. The results of the regression indicated that the model explained 2.88% of the variance and that the model was not significant. It was found that conscientiousness was a signifcant predictor of UEBs, while neuroticism was not.<nl>Discussion<nl>The results of the present study support the hypothesis that conscientiousness is a signficiant predictor of UEBs. However, neuroticism is not a significant predictor of UEBs and therefore does not support the hypothesis. The results regarding conscientiousness are consistent with previous research, as they found that low concientiousness predicted the consumption of unhealthy food (Keller &amp; Siegrist, 2015). <nl>A few limitations could be addressed in future research. Firstly, the present study used self-reported measures of personality traits and eating habits. This presents the possibility of measurement errors and response biases, particularly social desirability. This may also explain why neuroticism was not found to be a significant predictor of UEBs, as the trait is perceived as socially undesirable.<nl>Another limitation is that participants were predominantly female. This creates a gender disparity and may limit the finding’s generalisability to females only. Research has found gender differences in the relationship between personality traits and UEBs. For example, Conner, et al. (2017) found that high neuroticism led to UEBs in males only.<nl>Despite these limitations, understanding the influence of personality traits on eating habits is of paramount importance in developing effective interventions against unhealthy food intake that are tailored to each individual’s characteristic traits.<nl>To conclude, the present study confirms the importance of the conscientiousness trait in eating behaviours. However, further research is required to assess whether health behaviour predictions based on personality are affected by gender and social desirability bias.", "Hi Sophie, I have compiled a itinerary of all the things you would want to do on your trip to Helsinki for your two-day conference on the 2nd-4th September. Firstly, I have found a hotel called the Radisson Blue seaside hotel as i know you like the water and would want to be near it, this hotel is only 1 mile away from the Hetrikani beach and has stunning ocean views from the room. it is Â£77 a night within your budget and has many features such as AC, barlounge, a gym in case you would want to blow off any steam from the conference. It has many positive reviews and is deemed one of the best in Helsinki! It also is near many great sights so travelling will be very convenient. It is 6 mins from a museum as well as 2 mins from a escape room in case you would want to partake any other activities during your trip. The cafe I found for you to have breakfast at is called Eckberg cafe and is only a 12 min walk away from the hotel and they have many positive reviews and the images of the food also look amazing! The national museum of Finland are home to many artefacts and feature a great deal of history which will be perfect for you to get to know the history of the place and is only a 20 minute metro journey from the hotel, with the metro also near the hotel, perfect for travelling there! In terms of the restaurant, I found the restaurant Olo for you, it has a unique ambience with amazing food and are cautious with dietary requirements as I know you are allergic to shellfish. This restaurant is also close by to the hotel being 19 mins away! The lioporo gift shop is also home to some amazing handmade souvenir and typical souvenirs so you can get authentic gifts for your children, and again this is all close by so you don't have to worry about not having time due to your busy schedule! Finally, I know you wanted a nice live music venue to wind down in the evenings and I have found the Tavasata which is the no.1 live music venue in Helsinki and is described as legendary and iconic and is only 6 mins away! I will confer with you later about all these places and I hope they are to your liking. Best wishes, Sobia"]}

{"id": "6f6c7a2d-361e-4d06-9aea-1a2ee8b5b3bc", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Thank you for visiting. <nl><nl>Will you be able to bring a wrongful dismissal claim against Wildlife Wonders?<nl>To legally bring a Wrongful Dismissal Claim (WDC), the employer must have unjustifiably breached fundamental contractual clauses, resulting in the employee’s consequential loss. Applying this, did Wildlife Wonders (WW) breach a term in your contract, causing you consequential loss? You are likely to be successful arguing WW breached your implied term of mutual trust and confidence, as Narinder disrespected you in front of your colleagues and did not keep your performance issues confidential. Managers are obliged to ensure workplaces offer senses of belongingness and motivation, but this was not your experience. <nl><nl>You can argue breach of Job clause, because Narinder asked you to perform duties outside your contract which were unreasonable, given you are a cameraman and not a speaker. Narinder transferred you to Accounting, which is not the job responsibilities expected from a cameraman. This may give rise to a breach in your renumeration clause, because your accounting transfer, may have increased your salary and should be paid accordingly. Your resulting consequential loss resulting is your resignation and lack of work.<nl><nl>Eligibility to bring WDC, requires the claimant to be an employee. Applying the legal test of an employee, did you wear uniform whilst working? Were you integrated and controlled by WW employees? As your manager, Narinder assigned you projects. You used a company car. This validates you were sufficiently integrated and controlled within WW, deeming you an employee. <nl><nl>The law requires the claimant must be dismissed by their employer, under misconduct. WW did not dismiss you, but you resigned. The law recognises resignations as constructive dismissal, providing it has been done at a reasonable time, justified through contractual breaches and is evidenced in writing. You telephoned Narinder your resignation notice, giving reasons. This does not take imminent, legal effect because you must provide your resignation in writing. I advise you email Narinder your resignation notice, for this will reach Narinder faster. Following this, you will be eligible to bring WDC against WW. <nl><nl>Can you bring an Unfair Dismissal Claim against Wildlife Wonders?<nl>To bring an Unfair Dismissal Claim (UDC), the law requires the employer to defend the claimant’s claim. You are likely to succeed with UDC against WW, so I shall focus on this. <nl><nl>To be lawfully eligible, the claimant must be an employee. Following my explanation in WDC section, you satisfy this. Law places two additional requirements. Firstly, the claimant must not be excluded from claiming due to their occupation. A cameraman is very unlikely to be excluded and you have not signed a compromising agreement with WW. Secondly, the claimant must have worked for their employee for a continuous period of two years. you have worked for WW for ten years, allowing you eligibility to bring UDC.  <nl><nl>Procedural requirements<nl>Regarding time limits, the law established a 3 months minus one day from effective date of termination, deadline for WDC submitted to tribunals. WDC submitted to court have 6 year deadline.  If you resigned on 28th November 2020, you have until 27th February 2021 to submit your WDC to a tribunal. You will have until 27th November 2026 to submit your WDC to court. As you want to bring a WDC and UDC, you are advised to bring both claims to a tribunal. As your salary is £52,000, any award exceeding £25,000 will be taxed and presented in court. Bringing both claims, means your legal fees is likely to be subtracted from your compensation, allowing you to bring your claims to a tribunal.  <nl><nl>I advise you submit your WDC to the tribunal as soon as possible, I am happy to assist you with this. The tribunal requires you to attend Early Conciliation meeting to settle your dispute. ACAS is an independent statutory body, aiming to provide early conciliations. You will receive a certificate number which must be presented to the tribunal as evidence of attempted conciliation. If the dispute is not resolved with WW, the tribunal will give you an additional month to submit your WDC to them. You will have until 27 March 2021 to submit WDC. You still remain an employee of WW, as you have not evidenced your resignation in writing and have not been dismissed.<nl><nl>Like WDC, the law requires the claimant to have been dismissed by their employer. You must prove you have been dismissed from WW, namely confirming your resignation in writing. Like WDC, in UDC you must attend ACAS hearing, in an attempt to settle your dispute.  <nl><nl>If you choose to formally resign and have attended ACAS hearing, you must attach the certificate number onto the ET1 Tribunal Claim Form. I am happy to assist in completing this. This will be sent to WW, who will have 28 days to respond to your claim through the ET3 Tribunal Claim Form. <nl><nl>What would be the prospects of you succeeding with each claim?<nl>You have the burden to prove your WDC and UDC. As I stated, you are likely to successfully justify both claims. Once WW have received your ET1 Form, the burden will be on them to defend your claim. They must justify their actions as being reasonable, supporting your employment contract. Narinder will attempt to argue she was reasonable in sending you to different countries for projects,  as your job is to film nature. However, Narinder was unreasonable in being disrespectful to you. Given Narinder’s lack of knowledge and your strong reputation, Narinder should have understood you. <nl><nl>Narinder has not justified her reasons for transferring you to accounting, knowing it is outside your contract and you dislike it. This represents an unjustifiable breach in your job clause, as you were not contracted to deliver talks and work in accountancy but contracted to film creatures. Narinder is unlikely to successfully justify her disrespectful comments to you. Also, you did not consent to your performance issues (should remain confidential) being publicised. <nl><nl>WDC Prospect<nl>It is unlikely WW will succeed in defending your claim, unless it amounts to gross misconduct, or WW reverse their decision of you working in Accounting department and allow you to resume working as a cameraman. <nl><nl>A tribunal will lawfully consider gross misconduct, as evidence of the employee breaching their contract, so bad that it damages the relationship between the employer and employee. This would allow the employer to dismiss the employee, without worrying about potential WDC against them, as the employee’s breach has invalidated their contract and rights to notice. Here, WW best way of proving gross misconduct is through your poor performance in the last two-three years. The tribunal however, are more likely to consider this to be minor misconduct or serious misconduct. They will consider that your poor performance was due to WW breaching your job clause by assigning you duties which were outside of your contract and profession. The tribunal will also consider your strong reputation. <nl><nl>WW may be able to defend your WDC by reversing their decision of you working in accounting and allow you to resume working as a cameraman. You will only be successful in arguing breaches in your contract, if WW did not allow you to work your notice period or they paid you less than the value of your entitled benefits, namely your pension, paid leave, discretionary Christmas bonus and use of Land Rover.<nl><nl>In law, your minimum notice period is implied into your employment contract. The higher notice period indicated in your contract or legislation will prevail. Your contract entitles you to eight weeks’ notice, but law states you are entitled to ten weeks’ notice; as you have worked with WW for ten years. Therefore WW must pay you ten weeks’ worth salary notice, plus monetary value of benefits you would have been entitled to during your notice period. <nl><nl>However, if you choose to evidence your resignation in writing, your resignation will be legal meaning your right to work your notice period will be lost. However WW are legally obliged to fulfil your payment in lieu clause, by paying you monetary value for your company benefits such as paid leave, Christmas bonus, use of Land Rover and Pension scheme. <nl><nl>UDC Prospect <nl>It is unlikely WW will be able to defend your claim, unless they satisfy the tribunal’s requirements arguing they were fair and reasonable in dismissing you for one or more of the five reasons established in law and in doing so, they followed a fair dismissal procedure. Here the burden will be on WW to prove this and must also justify your resignation. If WW are unable to defend your resignation reasons (which I think is likely), you will succeed in arguing WW constructively dismissed you. <nl><nl>Applying this, WW may use ‘other substantial reason,’ ground to defend your dismissal; namely they incurred losses from your projects. Another fair reason WW may use to defend your dismissal may be ‘misconduct,’ regarding your work performance. This is unlikely to succeed, as WW would be required to follow ACAS Disciplinary Guidelines, such as opting for Mediation with you, before dismissing you. As with WDC, the tribunal would require evidence of your work performance from the last two-three years.<nl><nl>Whether you was dismissed withwithout notice, WW must prove they dismissed you following a fair and reasonable dismissal procedure. Here, after orally resigning you have not met with Narinder to further discuss your decision. As the employer, WW should have done this to ensure your dismissal was fair but because they did not, you are likely to be successful in arguing your UDC; as silence from your resignation was a negative response. <nl><nl>What are your options, and what would be the advantages and disadvantages of pursuing each option?<nl>Please find below a list of options available to you. <nl><nl>Option 1: Do not resign and tolerate Narinder’s behaviour.<nl><nl>Advantages:<nl>• You continue to have a regular job and income.<nl>• No stress about finding alternative work.<nl>• Saves time and money, as you will not spend thousands on your legal bill. <nl><nl>Disadvantage:<nl>• Narinder’s disrespectful behaviour may not change.<nl>• The reasonable time for you to resign and argue constructive dismissal from WW will pass. <nl><nl>Option 2: Do not resign, but seek an amicable solution to address Narinder’s behaviour. <nl><nl>Advantages: <nl>• Same as Option 1. <nl>• WW may appreciate your feedback, leading to improvements in Narinder’s behaviour. <nl>• WW may assign you a new line manager. <nl><nl>Disadvantage:<nl>• Same for Option 1, but hopefully this will not happen. <nl><nl>Option 3: Do not resign, but raise a grievance case against Narinder. <nl><nl>Advantages:<nl>• Same as option 2, however WW may consider this to be a drastic measure to take. <nl><nl>Disadvantage:<nl>• Same as Options 1-2. <nl><nl>Option 4: Hand in your notice but do not claim. <nl><nl>Advantages:<nl>• You will be free from Narinder’s treatment. <nl>• You will save time and money in bringing a claim against them.<nl>• You will receive all benefits you are entitled to during your notice period. <nl><nl>Disadvantages:<nl>• You will be unemployed after your notice period.<nl>• Stressful finding another job. <nl><nl>Option 5: Resign and argue constructive dismissal under WDC and UDC.<nl><nl>Advantages:<nl>• You will receive your entitled benefits had you worked your notice period. <nl>• You will feel happy seeing Narinder being disciplined for her behaviour.<nl>• Feel happy seeing WW negative publicity.<nl><nl>Disadvantages:<nl>• Same as Option 4.<nl>• There is no guarantee of winning which may waste your time and money. <nl><nl>I think Option 2 is beneficial to you, however it is your choice. <nl><nl>What remedies might you seek, and, if they include financial compensation, how much -providing figures where possible - is a court or tribunal likely to order Wildlife Wonders to pay out to you, should you succeed with each claim?<nl><nl>WDC<nl>The tribunal may award you financial compensation, an injunction andor declaration that WW wrongfully dismissed you. The tribunal is likely to award you compensation, as this suits your needs better because a declaration will financially damage WW more due to negative publicity. <nl><nl>Your compensation will be depend on if WW allow you to work your notice period or they pay you the monetary value of your entitled benefits instead. The tribunal will order WW to pay you 10 weeks’ worth salary (£10,000), as this is your legal notice period entitlement. This will include your benefits entitlements, namely your pension of approximately £4,000. Your notice will continue throughout the Christmas period, hence the tribunal will order WW to pay you your contractual Christmas Bonus (£1,560). As this is discretionary, the tribunal will order this, if you receive your ‘Christmas [bonus]’ regularly. If so, WW must pay your bonus, as this constitutes an employee contractual ‘right[s] to receive.’ <nl><nl>Currently, you have taken two days’ leave. I doubt you would taken more, during your notice. Legally, employers must compensate employees for untaken leave, because employers have benefitted from extra employee work. Therefore, the tribunal will award you 26 days’ worth salary (£3,703.96). To avoid this, WW may encourage you to take leave during your notice. <nl><nl>Your compensation totals £19,263.96. This includes notice salary (£10,000), Pension (£4,000), untaken leave (£3,703.96) and Christmas bonus (£1,560). Without Christmas bonus your compensation totals £17,703.96. Your desire to keep Land Rover may reduce your compensation. Subtracting the car, your compensation totals £11,763.96 or £10,203.96 without Christmas bonus. When negotiating with WW do not make it obvious you wish to keep the car. Given your strong reputation and to avoid publicity, WW may allow you to keep the car. If your accounting transfer increased your salary, the tribunal will order WW to pay the difference. Your overall compensation is below tribunal’s maximum award of £25,000. I advise you bring your WDC and UDC to a tribunal. <nl><nl>UDC<nl>The tribunal can lawfully re-instate you into your current job, with Narinder continuing as your manager. Or they may re-engage you into your current job, with a new manager and WW branch. The tribunal is unlikely to re-instate or re-engage you, as your relationship with WW is damaged. However, if you wish to be re-instated or re-engaged, the tribunal will consider this. <nl><nl>Your compensation will consist of basic and compensatory awards. <nl>Basic Award <nl>Tribunal will award you £6,300 based on your weekly gross salary (£525 cap), age, and 10 years of service. <nl><nl>Compensatory Award<nl>The maximum tribunal may award is your current gross salary (£78,000), as it is below £86,444 cap. This may be lower (£25,000), as this is fair, equitable; considering time taken to secure another job.<nl><nl>If both claims succeed, the tribunal will only award you compensation for UDC (£84,300) because this includes your salary and benefits lost during your notice. The tribunal may be inclined to reduce your compensation award, as early payments give you investment opportunities, but this is unlikely due to the Coronavirus recession. <nl><nl>Given your strong reputation, skills and compensation award, it is possible for you to create your own business providing you have no competitive restrictive covenants. The tribunal will consider this.  The tribunal will consider your skills, experience and how long it will take you to find another job. If you are currently looking for jobs and havewill attend an interview, please inform me because the tribunal will reimburse your expenses made, namely travel fee and newspapers subscriptions. <nl><nl>Additional information<nl>Please email me your employment contract, as I may identify further benefit entitlements and if WW can allow you to work your notice or pay you in lieu. If not, WW cannot enforce restrictive covenants and other clauses against you; for this invalidates your contract.<nl><nl>Please confirm if you have opted out of Working Time Regulations 1998, as this determines your ability to be compensated for untaken leave. <nl><nl>I leave you to reflect and will contact you for further instructions. <nl><nl>Yours Sincerely, <nl>", "lo,<nl><nl>I'll send them an email.

Firstly, I shortlisted Hotel: Marksi By Scandic which is based in the Helsinki city centre. I have selected the Classic Double room package which costs £157 per night. This package includes free breakfast which will be delivered to my CEO at her room, which means she need not travel out to a café. This package also contains a free re-booking policy which is very good in case she needs to change her booking due to COVID and can do so without worrying about paying extra money. Secondly, in case my CEO wanted to travel to a café to eat breakfast, I have selected the Fazer Café Kluuvikatu 3, café which is also based in the city centre and offers breakfast. It is rated 4-5 stars which is a good option. A restaurant i shortlisted was: Rosemariini, this includes vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes which is good for diversity of food and options. It offers different payment methods but currently offers a take away service. the Second restaurant i chose which is better than the first option is: Lappi Ravintola. this is a traditional restaurant with 4-5 star ratings and offers a 4 course meal, table booking and different payment methods i strongly recommend my CEO to visit this restaurant. Thirdly, the souvenir shop i have chosen for my CEO to visit is called: Moomin Shop Forum. This is based in the city centre and has received 4-5 star ratings from TripAdvisor. This gift shop contains gifts such as books, toys, cups and clothes which is highly ideal and beneficial for my CEO to buy gifts for herself and children as they may like books and toys. This gift shop is also based in international Helsinki airport as well as all over Helsinki so is easily accessible to visit. Finally, I have selected Helsinki City Museum to visit, as this is based in the city centre, not too far from the hotel. This also includes online exhibitions which is beneficial in case COVID was to increase in September and my CEO would be left with nothing to do, if this did happen then my CEO could attend online exhibitions too.

Questionnaires are a \"set of questions designed to produce the data needed in order to meet the research objectives\" (McDaniel and Gates, 2018). The aim of this research is: \"To gain an insight into individuals’ preferences as to whether or not they believe they would benefit from the launch of an app.\" The questionnaire will consist of various questions where the participant will rate their opinion using a Likert scale: \"A measurement scale where the respondent indicates a level of agreement or disagreement to the given statements…\" (McDaniel and Gates, 2018). An example of the questionnaire is shown by appendix 1.<nl><nl>This method is most favourable as the sample population is large. Other survey methods such as telephone interviews or face-to-face interviews are time consuming as they require an individual (usually an experienced interviewer) to contact the participant and have a conversation with them. Therefore, for this research it is impractical. It is advised having a sample size of n=400, however, having a read of n=80 or above for each subgroup will allow to draw strong conclusions. The advantage is that it will be easier to analyse results amongst the subgroups specified in the target population. Quantitative methods aim for conclusiveness and generalisability. Therefore, once there is solid evidence to support the question, no further testing is required.<nl><nl>Sampling Approach<nl><nl>The most appropriate sampling technique is cluster sampling. This technique is part of \"probability sampling where the population is divided into groups\" (McDaniel and Gates, 2018) and then randomly sampled from each group. This is the preferred method as it allows to select an equal number of participants per group, allowing for fairness and reliability. Cluster sampling involves gathering the entire population of the study and dividing them into clusters. Each cluster is a representation of the entire population. Once the clusters have been identified, certain clusters will be chosen using simple random sampling. Only the participants who meet one or more of the ‘Target Population\" criteria will be used for the study. The unchosen clusters (those who do not meet the criteria) will remain unrepresented in the study. For this study, participants will be grouped by age, and then participants will be chosen randomly to be included in the data analysis. 100 participants per age group will be selected to allow fairness.  <nl><nl><nl><nl>Data Collection Method and Analysis<nl><nl>As mentioned previously, online questionnaires will be used due to the type of research being conducted and the size of the target sample population. Questionnaires will be sent out to every individual who has provided an e-mail address to Specsavers and given consent to receive the questionnaire. Online questionnaires allow the researcher to contact multiple participants at once. As a result, they have higher response rates as well as the ability to contact the hard-to-reach. Moreover, it is quick to create and allows for adaptability and personalisation of questions. There are no physical materials needed to send the questionnaire (paper, envelope etc.) so there are fewer expenses incurred. There may also be less bias as without an interviewer present, respondents are able to answer truthfully. Additionally, anonymity also encourages truthful answers.<nl><nl>Respondents will be given 4 weeks to complete the questionnaire from the date of visit to the store. Once completed, the results will be put onto a spreadsheet categorised by age (groups of 10 years). Once all 400 responses have been recorded, it will be analysed by calculating the averages of each question. This will help identify what customers prefer or not. For example, an average score of 1-3 shows customers disagree with the statements, 4 shows they are neutral, and a score between 5-7 means they agree. The ratings will give a good indication on whether it is beneficial to launch the app, and what features should be included.<nl><nl>A timings and costings table has been provided in the appendix (appendix 2) to highlight a more detailed overview of the length of the research project (3 months) and the total cost of the research project (£28,000). <nl><nl>Ethical Issues<nl><nl>There are many ethical principles regarding the use of online surveys, the most important one being informed consent – participants within reason know what they are going to be doing. In addition, participation should be voluntary and anonymous. Questions should also avoid physical and psychological harm to the participants. All measures have been taken to ensure ethical principles have been followed. For example, informed consent will happen when customers arrive for their appointment. They will be asked whether they would like to partake in an online survey. If answered yes, only then will an e-mail containing the survey be sent.", "<addr5_FN>,<nl><nl>Thank you for your email and very detailed feedback.

Firstly, I understand that you are wanting a hotel by the water. I have found the 'Hilton Helsinki Strand' (£159 on Booking.com) which I hope would be to your taste. It is located right by the sea, and has free internet. It is rated 4.5 stars on TripAdvisor and is within walking distance to the city center. The furnishings are fairly modern. For your breakfast cafe I found two options. Firstly, there is the 'Early Bird'. This is a nine minute walk from the hotel mentioned, and had positive reviews. Secondly, I found the 'Ipi Kulmakuppila' which is a ten minute walk from the hotel mentioned, and serves pastries, whilst also offering a buffet brunch which many people raved about within reviews. A good museum I found was the 'Helsinki City Museum' which \"documents and displays the history of Helsinki\". I know you wanted to learn about the city's history, so thought this would be a good one to look at. I also found a restaurant that serves 'Poronkaristys' which is Helsinki's national dish. The restaurant is called 'Lappi Ravintola' and has 4.5 stars on Google Reviews. I know you would love to get your children a nice souvenir, so I found the shop 'Kankurin Tupa', which is rated 4.3 on Google Reviews. It has a lot of traditional Helsinki souvenirs. Just so you are aware, it closes at 6pm and opens at 10am. Finally, I thought you might be interested in the live music of Helsinki which I know you enjoy. Two top rated locations are 'G LiveLab' which is a bluesjazz club. It is rated number nine of the 'Concerts and Shows of Helsinki' on TripAdvisor. It has great reviews; 4 stars on TripAdvisor and 4.6 on Google Reviews. Another option is 'Storyville' which is a jazz club. It is rated 4.1 on Google Reviews, and one reviewer even said it might just have the best live music in the world - I'll let you be the judge. I hope this information was helpful to you, and I hope you have a great trip.

{"id": "feb81bfb-74ba-4b91-b744-93c875c42085", "discourse_types": ["essay", "text_message"], "pair": ["This essay will look to answer the question above, ‘To what extent does sport foster and reproduce a hyper-consumerist culture?’. Hyper-consumerism refers to ‘the consumption of goods for non-functional purposes and the associated significant pressure to consume those goods, exerted by modern capitalist society, as those goods shape one’s identity’ (Wikipedia, 2020), in simpler forms, ‘a consumerism for the sake of consuming’ (Lunning, F., 2014). There are a number of ways that the theory of hyper-consumerism can be applied to the subject of sport and sports relation to hyper-consumerism. However, there are a number of ways that sport can be considered as not fostering and reproducing hyper-consumerism and instead an area affected by hyper-consumerism. <nl><nl>There are a number of highly popular professional sports that over the last 3 decades have seen the change of consumerism within the professional sport. Hyper-consumerism in a number of professional sports. One professional sport where there has been an abundance of growth in consumerism and profitability is professional football. The Premier League teams of England are projected to pull in £5.4bn in the 202021 season (Deloitte, 2020). With £1.35bn (25%) of this coming from commercial business for the Premier League clubs. The Premier League generates the most revenue out of all the top 5 European football leagues by roughly £1.5bn over the closest league, Spain at £3.38bn. The scale of these figures show the high expenditure within football leagues but especially the Premier League. It also shows the size of the commercial brands of the Premier League teams. Specifically the annual revenue of the big 6 Premier League teams totalling £4.13bn (Sports Pro Media, 2020). This revenue causes high expenditure on transfers and wages for players. This lavish spending fosters a lifestyle that is presented to fans and these fans want to be a part of whether its buying a jersey of the team they support or buying a season ticket to watch their team every weekend. These actions are a perfect example of hyper-consumerism culture with these goods being non-functional and possess a significant pressure in the supporters life and take control of their lives when the games are being played. <nl><nl>Although hyper-consumerism does play a role within sports, as presented above, however, is the growth of revenues within football fostered by hyper-consumerism not the other way round? Hyper-consumerism is a theory that has been around longer than the growth in revenues for sports with its close association with globalisation and cultural homogenisation (McGregor, S., 2007). With this considered if there was a lack of globalisation and cultural homogenisation would we see the high revenue of the top global sporting leagues such as  the NFL, NBA, MLB and the Premier League, which all are valued between £5bn and £11bn (AP Sports Editor, 2020). Without the human nature of greed that causes hyper-consumerism would we instead see these leagues having significantly lower revenue. This is just one factor that could suggest in my opinion that hyper-consumerism fosters sports and the growth of sports. It can also be considered that hyper-consumerism and sports are actually symbiotic, in which they work in a close relationship as one grows the other grows and vice-versa. <nl> <nl>Another factor that supports the idea of sports fostering and reproducing hyper-consumerism is that of the growing expenditure of households on sports. According to a study by Sheffield Hallam University, the average household expenditure on sports in 2002 was £11.38, however, as of 2018 the average household expenditure on sports was £76.80 (Gov.uk, 2019).  This is a 674% increase in expenditure over 16 years or 42% per year. This tremendous growth in expenditure is similar to the growth in revenue of the most popular UK sporting league, the Premier League, which over 16 years saw its revenues grow from £1.25bn (Deloitte, 2003) to £5.4bn, a growth of 432% or 27% . This shows as a professional sport league grows so does the expenditure by a household. Thus showing evidence of how sport can reproduce and foster a hyper-consumerism culture which is clearly evident in the UK. This culture has significantly grown in the UK over the last two decades and I will look at further into this essay. <nl><nl>Although there is evidence of hyper-consumerism having a relationship to sport, there is also evidence of hyper-consumerism being caused by the growth of technology. A prime example of this is the hyper-consumerism of the United Arab Emirates. The UAE has seen a growth of hyper-consumerism with the growth of technology within the country’s economy (Kazim, A., 2018). With an abundance of mega malls and the growth of internet shopping the culture in UAE over the last 50 years has transferred from traditional markets to a hyper-consumer culture of luxury global brands. The growth in this culture in the UAE is seen further with the growth of the country’s GDP per capita which, as of 2019, totaled $69,900 (Societe Generale, 2019). This is a stark contrast to 1975 when the GDP per capita was at $26,847 (World Bank, 2019). These statistics suggest a substantial growth in the economy which has come with a growth in consumerism. This suggests the theory that the main cause of hyper-consumerism is the growth of an economy. Further evidence of this is the lack of sport participation in the UAE this hyper-consumerist market exists in a culture in which roughly only 6% of the population plays a sport over 3 times a week. Reinforcing that instead of the sports being played fostering hyper-consumerism instead its the growth of globalisation and technology fostering hyper-consumerism. Ultimately, this shows that hyper-consumerism can exist without a large presence of sport within the economy. <nl><nl>This hyper-consumerist culture that has been seen in the United Arab Emirates is prominently the whole world over. However, there is clear and specific sport  that can be given as evidence for fostering and reproducing hyper-consumerism. One such sport is basketball and specifically the NBA (National Basketball Association). A prime example within the sport is the Air Jordan brand, owned by Nike and named after the critically acclaimed greatest player of all time, Michael Jordan. The Air Jordan brand, launched in 1984, in 2019, had revenues totalling $3.1 billion which made up 8% of Nike’s revenues in the same year (Forbes, 2020). This along with the revenue of the NBA itself of $8.4 billion shows the massively consumer nature of the NBA in the US (ESPN, 2020). Within the NBA the most popular consumer good is team jerseys, the average price of these is $110, approx. £81 (The Street, 2020). This high priced consumer good along with the cost of attending an NBA game of roughly $89. This fits perfectly the nature of goods that are typical of a hyper-consumerist culture described in the introduction. These goods are not something that is functional but people want and purchase for their lives to fit in with the culture. <nl><nl>Hyper-consumerism is caused by a number of economic factors and the sports economic growth is instead down to the existence of hyper-consumerism. An economic factor is globalisation, with the growing number of accessible non-functional goods hyper-consumerism has become a causal byproduct. This can be seen in sports as seen above with the English Premier League growing to revenues of £5.4bn in 2020. With the league being watched globally in 188 of 193 countries (Premier League, 2019). Without globalisation there would not be abundant accessibility of sports to consumers. With the growth of commercial sports media on the internet in places such as Youtube, with 79% of users watching sports on the platform (Youtube, 2020). Globalisation of markets has caused  hyper-consumerism and greater accessibility to sports that would not be possible without globalisation. . <nl><nl>Previously I have discussed the growing sporting culture and spectator sports in the UK and its role in fostering hyperconsumerism. This is an area that has seen significant growth and can be used as evidence. On the subject of spectator sports, on average in the UK expenditure by spectators is £54 per person (not including ticket price) (Sports England, 2019). This shows sports fostering hyper-consumerism as when attending these events spectators are spending money for non-functional purposes. Furthermore, the UK sporting goods market is expected to have grown by 3.5% in 2020 despite the COVID-19 pandemic (Ibis World, 2020) . Largely caused by the increase of people exercising during the national lockdowns ordered by the UK Government. This being reinforced by the statistics, from Sport England, that 63% of people saying that they exercise over 3 days a week in the first National Lockdown. This shows that even in a time of economic negativity with the UK economy shrinking by 3.4% (PWC, 2020) there was still significant consumer spending on sport showing the level of consumers wants and needs to spend on the non-functional goods or services. This growth in the market even in the pandemic is far greater than other non-functional goods in this time and show the nature of sports fostering and reproducing hyper-consumerism. <nl><nl>Throughout this essay I have compared aspects in which that sport both does foster and reproduce hyper-consumerism but also doesn’t. The aspects that sport shows to foster and reproduce is through the growth of popular leagues such as the English Premier League and these top leagues promoting a lifestyle, the growing of UK household expenditure on watching professional sports, sporting good brands promoted through professional sports such as the NBA and the Air Jordan brand, expenditure on attending spectator sports and purchases at these events. All these aspects promote a clear message that sports play a role in hyper-consumerism at the bare minimum. Whether sport ‘fosters and reproduces’ hyper-consumerism is highly contestable. Shown by the evidence presented hyper-consumerism can exist and grow without an overarching presence of sport, as seen with the UAE in which the average GDP per capita has grown from $26,847 in 1975 to $69,900 in 2019. This staggering growth in GDP per capita has caused a growth in the consumerist culture which is highly focused on luxury consumer brands. This hyper-consumerist market exists in a culture in which roughly only 6% of the population plays a sport over 3 times a week. In conclusion, I think that, firstly, sport can foster and reproduce hyper-consumerism. However, I believe that hyper-consumerism does not need sports to grow as shown with the case of the United Arab Emirates, although this is a rarity and to fully determine how common of an occurrence this can be further research needs to be done. Finally, although sport does foster hyper-consumerism it is only possible with globalisation and instead globalisation is the major foster and reproducer of hyper-consumerism and sports is an area that is consumed by the hyper-consumerist culture we have.

{"id": "80621deb-3704-4f31-bc06-33a9b59df51d", "discourse_types": ["essay", "text_message"], "pair": ["Subsequent to losing the 1983 election on a hardline socialist programme, it became clear that a rebranding of the Labour Party was crucial. The term \"New Labour\" was initially coined by Tony Blair at the 1994 Labour Party Conference, inspired by sociologist Anthony Giddens who believed that it was important to find a \"third way\" between Thatcherism and traditional socialism. The question in hand explores the way in which the Labour Party’s place on the political spectrum has changed through the complexities of several policies introduced over the years. In this essay, I will be assessing the extent to which the Labour Party has been redefined from the Blair-era over two decades ago, to Corbynism today. It is worthwhile dealing with the topic at hand as politics is a subject which needs to be continuously adapting to reflect changes in global dynamics, this topic in particular reveals how government policies develop to maintain dialogue and preserve stability in an increasingly fragile and threatened geopolitical system.<nl><nl>Blair’s creation of New Labour attempted to formulate an alternative to traditional social democracy and free-market neo-liberalism in the context of a modern globalised economy. This neo-revisionism advocated a balance of rights and responsibilities, resulting in communitarian liberalism which emphasised that personal autonomy operates within a communal context based on mutual dependence and benefit. As Brown’s government ensured no radical breakaway from New Labour, ideals and principles of the Labour Party remained the same for many years. However, it is important to note that the Labour government’s failures in the early 21st century appear to have fundamentally changed voters’ views on whether Labour can be trusted on the economy, leading to a Conservative victory in the 2010 general election. This is largely significant as throughout the recent years, the Labour Party seems to have adopted more socialist principles, evident in Corbyn’s left-wing agenda. Therefore, I aim to argue that the Labour party has evolved to a large extent over the years due to many successes and failures of the party leaders’ policies.<nl><nl>In this essay I have used a range of books, websites and JSTOR journals. Previously published academic works include New Labour Hard Labour? Restructuring and resistance in the welfare industry by Gerry Mooney and Alex Law, as well as books such as Leadership and the Labour Party by John Gaffney. In these sources, the key concepts are focussing on New Labours’ appeal to the masses and rebranding of the party. These journals and books gave clear statistics taking an innovative approach as well as differing opinions on the main policies which redefined the Labour Party which provided useful insight and information. To gain better understanding of the authors to ensure reliability of my resources I also did some prior research on them. There were many crossovers to other academic disciplines such as economics and history, especially when researching Blair and Brown’s economic policies there were many statistics and economic theory. However, there were also weaknesses in the sources I used such as the author’s personal opinion being a large influence.<nl><nl>After four general election defeats, the Labour Party realised that traditional class-based political ideas and concepts were no longer seen as acceptable by the British electorate. As a result, the New Labour governments aimed to differentiate themselves from earlier social democratic administrations, by conserving resources before investing more in key public services. Blair modernised the Labour party to appeal more to middle-class voters by moving away from traditional policies such as nationalisation and emphasising constitutional reform. ‘Clause IV’ of the party constitution was abandoned, ties with trade unions were loosened and the party moved away from its previously hard-left position. Labour also became more pro-European as the EU adopted policies that protected workers’ rights such as the Social Chapter, and the Third way brought market models to some government-run services and aroused interest across the western world. Labour policies were largely based around the free-market, which was accepted as the best form of wealth creation with further privatisation and reduced corporate taxes to encourage enterprise. Greater emphasis was placed on individualism and communitarianism with the belief that the individual should realise their own potential and that everyone has a responsibility to care for the community collectively. Moreover, \"as part of its wider reform of the welfare and modernisation agendas, New Labour [had] sought to emphasise the role and responsibilities of family and community in the provision of welfare services\" (Mooney, 2007). Here it is evident that the sole focus of neo-revisionism was essentially a Labour rebranding exercise to appeal to the masses and attract business interests following four consecutive UK general election defeats, it introduced important measures that promoted social justice and improved the position of the most disadvantaged in society. The government had aimed to differentiate themselves from earlier social democratic administrations and had done so very well.<nl><nl>This rebranded party proved to be largely successful for the first few years and the idea of the \"Third way\" appealed largely to the masses, however over time, Blair’s popularity began to decline. Although the Conservatives lost the 2001 election, they persisted in arguing that New Labour wasn’t delivering its policy promises. This began to prove effective as there was a significant fall in the number of people who expected service delivery to either get better or much better over the next few years as \"healthcare by September 2003 8 per cent fewer people expected the NHS to ‘get better’ over the following year. At the same time, the government’s satisfaction ratings fell sharply from a 54 per cent in September 2001, to 36 per cent in September 2002 and 25 per cent in September 2003\" (Hindmoor, 2005). There are many reasons as to why this happened, the main being the tragedy of Iraq which ensnared him so completely that by Summer of 2007 he had acknowledged he would be a liability in the campaign to keep Britain in the European Union. It is believed that \"Iraq [had] come to dominate the Blair legacy to such an extent that many of his notable achievements – the Good Friday agreement, devolution to Scotland and Wales, the minimum wage and a number of social reforms are doomed to shelter under its shadow\" (BBC News, 2019). As a combined result of the Blair–Brown pact, Iraq war and low approval ratings, pressure built up within the Labour Party for Blair to resign and Brown was chosen to replace him in an uncontested election.<nl><nl>The Financial crisis and recession of 2008-09 led to a minor shift in policy by the Brown government but still maintained a majority of the New Labour values and principles. Gordon Brown had primacy over vast areas of domestic policy and handled the banking collapse, as the unpopularity of the Iraq war had meant that a new focus was needed for the party. In its foreign policy choices, the Brown government was quite similar to that of Tony Blair’s as it \"displayed the same unshakeable Atlanticism, pronounced Euroscepticism, and commitment to increasing international aid to 0.7% of gross national income as its coalition successor\" (Lee, 2019). In both health and education, \"Brown continued the Blair governments’ pattern of top-down reorganisation of hospitals and schools, and the increasing use of private sector finance and organisations to deliver services\" (Lee, 2019). He supported increased spending on hospitals, pledged to make reform of the NHS a major priority and also promised to retain the public-sector reforms implemented by Blair. In domestic policy terms, the impact of devolution meant that the Brown government’s capacity to reform public services was confined to England, where Brown had no personal democratic mandate to intervene.<nl><nl>Although, Brown retained a vast majority of Blair’s policies, he set out plans to decentralise Britain and make good the more evident weaknesses of Blairism, not least its careless disregard for civil liberties. However, two developments quickly derailed the new prime minister’s hopes. In \"August 2007 the first cracks appeared in the international banking system, cracks that would lead to the run on the Northern Rock bank the first run on a bank in Britain for 150 years – and its eventual nationalisation by New Labour – an irony after years of pro-business rhetoric\" (White, 2019). After initial rises in opinion polls following Brown becoming Prime Minister, Labour's popularity declined with the onset of a recession in 2008 leading to poor results in the local and European elections in 2009. Brown had broken an earlier promise not to raise income tax levels by creating a new 50% band, to be paid by those who earned more than £150,000 a year which led to claims that New Labour ideology had been abandoned. <nl><nl>Despite a Conservative rule, Ed Miliband struggled to balance his more left-wing views with a desire to appeal to the centre ground. Under his leadership the Labour Party maintained some elements of New Labour policies, while shifting slightly to the left. The new leader called for the restoration of the 50 per cent top rate of income tax and the need to re-establish Labour’s reputation as a competent manager of the economy was an important concern for Miliband. He tried to combine New Labour’s support for business with the defence of the party’s core working-class constituency by drawing a distinction between what he called ‘predatory’ and ‘responsible capitalism. At the 2015 election Miliband pledged to reduce the deficit every year of the next parliament. He insisted that Labour’s spending plans would be paid for without additional borrowing. \"Miliband [pledged] to fund the NHS improvements with a mansion tax on properties worth over £2m. other tax pledges include the restoration of the 10p tax band for low earners\" (The Independent, 2019). However, by 2015 there was pressure from the left of the party for Labour to adopt a much more radical approach. Some party member attributed the landslide victory of the SNP in Scotland, where Labour was left with just one Westminster seat, to the party being insufficiently left wing.<nl><nl>\"Labour's manifesto is one of the most radical proposed overhauls of the way companies are owned and run in decades. It would mark the biggest ownership takeover by the state since the nationalisations that occurred after the outbreak of World War Two\" (BBC News, 2019). Jeremy Corbyn sinisterly told photographers and journalists \"under Socialism you will all cooperate\" (Express.co.uk, 2019) suggesting a radical shift to the left. He took the Miliband-balls idea of increased investment in the economy further, calling for large-scale funding of industry and infrastructure organised by a National Investment Bank. He called for the renationalisation of the railways, a policy the New Labour governments refused to adopt. Instinctively supporting intervention of an Old Labour kind, he demanded that companies publish pay audits with the aim of countering discrimination in the workplace. \"Labour has pledged to rejuvenate the UK's neglected high streets, nationalize public services and some major industries, and force all large firms to give their employees a share of the business and a voice on their boards. Critics of Labour say these policies are throwbacks to failed socialist governments of the 1970s\" (Vonberg, 2019). Like Miliband, he favoured the restoration of the 50 per cent top rate of income tax. However, Corbyn was much more clear-cut in his competition to austerity, characterising it as a political choice that harmed the most vulnerable members of society, rather than an economic necessity. Many bold claims have been made about Corbyn with \"Corbyn may not be a Communist, but he’s certainly a Marxist\" (The Northern Echo, 2019) being one of the boldest. Corbyn strongly opposed benefit cuts and a socialist he regarded the poor as the victims of capitalism, who are entitled to public support. He opposed the use of the private sector to deliver public services – a central aspect of New Labour. Thus, he argued for a wholly state-run NHS. In order to promote lifelong education and training, he called for a national education service, and opposed student tuition fees. By contrast, Ed Miliband had confined himself to advocating their reduction from £9,000 to £6,000 a year. In terms of law and order policy, Corbyn was opposed to the more hard-line policies of the New Labour era, such as increased powers to combat terrorism and the introduction of identity cards. This became a less controversial policy area within the labour party – both Blairites and Corbynites found common ground in opposing government cuts to police number. Corbyn consistently voted against the use of force and favoured the withdrawal of the UK from NATO’s military structure and the abolition of the Trident nuclear weapons system, again placing him at odds with New Labour. `He followed the mainstream of his party in supporting continued British membership of the EU, emphasising its positive role in protecting workers’ rights.<nl><nl>In conclusion, it is evident that the Labour Party had been redefined to a large extent, beginning as a more centrist party in 1997 and eventually becoming a more radical socialist party in present day. Through several policy failures, the Labour Party established that it needed to rebrand itself once again to adapt to current affairs. It is evident that Gordon Brown maintained a large amount of the New Labour principles however, Ed Miliband realised that this new and reformed party wasn’t going to get them through the 2015 election. This resulted in more left-wing agendas being proposed and the Labour Party promoting themselves as a more socialist organisation. Thus, to conclude, the Labour Party has been redefined to a large extent with several shifts throughout the political spectrum over the years.", "lo<new>Can u lmk if ur going bullring today pls<new>So I don’t have to take a trip alone LOOOOL<new>What are they called<new>I am going primark<new>You may see me tmo tho<new>I can come to town before u go<new>Okay I’ll come with you again tmo<new>I’ll check for you today<new>It’s <day> so hopefully a while<new>And lockdown being enforced <day> hopefully<new>Not <day><new>So should be okay x<new>Bc I’ll stay with you<new>Until your train<new>And then come back x<new><addr1_FN><new><addr1_FN><new>Guess who my flatmates is<new><pers_FN><new>I live<new>With <pers_FN><new><addr1_FN><new>I can’t<new>Both of them<new>Hate my life"]}

In this study, participants were presented with words of colours and were asked to respond to the font colour. The words either matched their font colour (congruent) or were dissimilar to their font colour (incongruent). Their reaction time was measured in milliseconds (ms) across 60 trials and comparisons were drawn between the two conditions. The mean reaction time was 878.8ms for the congruent condition and 966.8ms for incongruent. This difference is significant.<nl><nl>Introduction<nl>When performing the classic Stroop task, participants were asked to identify the colour of a printed word and ignore its meaning (Entel &amp; Tzelgov, 2018). The Stroop effect occurs when the written word (\"blue\") is printed in a non-matching font colour (red) which delays reaction time. The stimuli (words) are incongruent and reaction time is affected by the automatic cognitive process of reading words. (Stroop, 1935; Braisby &amp; Gellatly, 2012; Grondin, 2016). <nl>Previous research has suggested that incongruent stimuli delays reaction times than congruent stimuli. There is literature that suggests that this is a consistent effect. <nl>Stroop (1935) compared the difference in time for reading words printed in black and coloured ink (2.3 seconds) then the difference in naming colours of the squares and font colour (47.0 seconds). <nl><figure><nl><nl>Results from Stroop (1935) showed that reaction times slowed, by an average 110.3 seconds (Goodwin, 2010), when the font colour was different from the meaning of the word (for example, when ‘red’ was written in yellow ink) in comparison to naming the word in colour (43.3 seconds) - 67 seconds difference.<nl><figure><nl>Other studies have also shown this effect such as Datta, Nebhinani &amp; Dixit (2019). Datta et al. (2019) compared the difference in reaction times in three conditions (neutral, congruent and incongruent). The incongruent condition (condition 3), had participants reacting to both Hindi and English versions of the Stroop task where the words were written in both English and Hindi. The incongruent condition meant the name of the colour-word did not match with the font colour (Datta et al., 2019). The study had 42 participants and each condition of each language had 48 trials.<nl>Results from Datta et al. (2019) showed a mean of 1051.93 milliseconds (ms) in the English version incongruent condition which was 54.8 ms slower than the Hindi version in condition 3 (997.13 ms) and 151.63 ms slower when comparing to the English version in Condition 2 (900.30 ms).<nl>These researchers found that incongruent trials took longer to respond to than congruent trials, therefore the prediction for this study was that students would take longer to react to stimuli in the incongruent condition than reacting to stimuli in the congruent condition.<nl><nl>Method<nl>Design<nl>The experiment used a repeated measures design. The independent variable was congruency with two levels - incongruent and congruent. The dependent variable was reaction time measured in milliseconds.<nl><nl>Participants<nl>Overall, there were 59 participants. All were Psychology Undergraduate students from Aston University and a volunteer sample, recruited through University comms.<nl><nl>Apparatus and Materials<nl>Participants used personal computers to complete the experiment. This study used PsychoPy to collect data – an experimental software which recorded participants reaction time. <nl>The words used were ‘Red’, ‘Green’, and ‘Blue’ (See Figure. 3, Figure. 4 and Figure. 5). The font used was Arial, with the stimuli positioned in the centre of the screen at (0,0). The response options were keyboard arrow keys, left for ‘red’ ink, up for ‘green’ and right for ‘blue’. There were 10 reps to each 6 stimulus types, totalling 60 trials in blocks of 10.<nl><figure><nl>Procedure<nl>Participants gave consent to participate in the study and took part in the experiment individually.<nl>At the beginning of the experiment, participants received written instructions on their monitor. Participants read the instructions in their own time before pressing an arrow on the keyboard to begin the experiment. The instructions described what the participants were to do and which keys they would need to use to respond to the stimuli. (See Appendix 1 for full instructions.).<nl>The stimuli were presented on the computer in a random sequence, the words appearing singularly, on the monitor, centre-screen, and only disappearing when participants pressed an accepted key. The experiment ended when all 60 trials were completed.<nl><nl>Results <nl><table><nl>Table 1 shows that mean reaction times were longer in the colour incongruent than colour congruent condition. Both SDs are high relative to the mean, this suggests the data may not be reliable as there are large within condition differences. However, a Wilcoxon signed ranks test showed that this difference was highly statistically significant (T = 403.0 , N = 59, p&lt;.001).<nl><nl>Discussion<nl>Conclusion<nl>The results are consistent with the hypothesis of this study and previous research, as participants took longer to react to stimuli in the incongruent condition than the congruent condition – statistically significant. This suggests that reaction time was affected by the automatic cognitive process of reading words when attempting to react to the colour (Stroop, 1935; Braisby et al. 2012; Grondin, 2016; MacLeod, 1991). Cohen, Dunbar &amp; McClelland (1990) would suggest that this also illustrates the way people process information and people’s capacity for selective attention.<nl><nl>Methodological Issues<nl>Due to the way the experiment was ran, participants completed the study not in a standardised environment, completing the study on the different computers or PCs in dissimilar environments. If this study were repeated, participants would use a standard University computer.

In Interfoto Picture Library Ltd v Stiletto Visual Programmes Ltd , Lord Bingham defined what good faith is synonymic to, which was \"playing fair\", \"coming clean\" or \"putting one’s card face upwards on the table\". This approach has been embodied by most countries outside the common law world, whereby, there is an overriding principle of good faith. However, English law, tends to abide by a piecemeal technique, which means good faith is applied as and when it is needed, rather than a general law. Nonetheless, the courts have more recently signalled a departure from such approach, as it has become increasingly more common for courts to uphold the express contractual promises to negotiate in good faith, and in doing so, have caused a level of uncertainty within the law.<nl>This essay will argue that the approach Courts have taken to enforce promises to negotiate in good faith is in fact unsatisfactory. This essay develops, first, by explaining the general obligations of good faith and the traditional hostility towards it. Secondly, it will focus specifically on the express contractual promises to negotiate in good faith and, whether, in fact, this has been enforceable. Finally, it will be explained that, despite the attempts to define what the Courts will uphold in relation to the enforceability of express contractual promises to negotiate, it inevitably leads to courts being too involved in commercial business and therefore, undermines the commercial stability that England places on high importance.<nl><nl>Traditional Views Towards Good Faith<nl>Historically, hostility towards the doctrine of good faith has been prevalent in English law.  Traditionally, English law develops piecemeal solution in response to the specific problems they are faced with, rather than an imposing an overriding principle of good faith. The reasoning, for this, is it creates too much uncertainty and subjectivity, but arguably, more importantly, it allows for freedom of contract and party of autonomy. As put by, Sir Roy Goode \"in what we like to think – perhaps wrongly – is the world's leading financial centre, the predictability of the legal outcome of a case is more important than absolute justice. It is necessary in a commercial setting that businessmen at least should know where they stand.\" Thus, indicating, why the original approach to good faith, is satisfactory because it leads to commercial certainty, which is ingrained into English law. This is fundamental to the core, further evidenced, by the fact \"the world's leading financial centre, the predictability of the legal outcome of a case is more important than absolute justice.\"  <nl>Conversely, this certainty that is placed on such high importance in English law, is being undermined by the exceptions where English law does recognise good faith, one of them being express promises to negotiate in good faith. Thus, meaning it is enforceable in courts. Many of these express terms to negotiate are based on the perception that both parties will be entering a joint venture, as there would be an intention to create a long term relation and parties may set out commitments for a specific time. The declarations made in the House of Lords decisions of HIH Casualty v Chase Manhattan Bank , Lord Hoffman observes  that it goes without saying that underlying the contractual arrangement of the parties there will be a common assumption that the parties involved will behave honestly. Although, there may be express terms to negotiate in good faith, the nature of these relationships alone, should call for honest, open and fair dealing. This is considered to be a relational contract. Leggatt LJ explains that communication and co-operation is based on trust and loyalty might be crucial and impliedly expected by the parties, even if not expressly stated in contract.  However, there is an issue with this definition as it has been criticised for a lack of explanation, as put by Severine Saintier, Leggatt J does not elaborate as to what relational contracts are precisely, why they require such enhanced good faithloyalty or what this would entail, which is regrettable. Such criticism simply strengthens the Court’s previously hostile approach to the doctrine; due to the ambiguity in interpretation of the doctrine as there are no guidelines as to how the Court is to identify \"good faith\", and so is often done so subjectively. <nl><nl>Express Promises To Negotiate In Good Faith<nl>Nevertheless, express terms to promise to negotiate in good faith, has been favoured and welcomed; due to the flexibility and adaptability it allows for within the contract. The freedom of inserting an article that mandates a negotiation, means that parties are able to prepare themselves for future, as the future is uncertain, they are unable to dictate what the commercial environment may look like in 20 years. For instance, events, such as a recession or a plummet in the market by including a term that opens the door for renegotiations in relation to the specific term. Cases, such as Petromec , the clause was 12.4 , where it states that ‘ Brasoil agrees to negotiate in good faith with Petromc the extra costs..’ This term emphasises why parties may include an express term in the contract for future insulation against potential risks that may occur.<nl><nl>Enforceability of Promises to Negotiate through Development of Law.<nl>Case law paves the way for the enforceability of contractual promises to negotiate in good faith, by refining the scope of good faith. Walford v Miles, the case was as follows, the business owner promised the plaintiffs that it would terminate negotiations to sell business to third party, however, the business owner then sold the business to a third party. The plaintiffs argued that the business owner had a duty to negotiate in good faith. However, it was held that the promise to negotiate was unenforceable. Lord Ackner to be \"unworkable\" and \"inherently repugnant to the adversarial position of the parties when involved in negotiations.\" It is imperative for distinctions to be made between a good faith duty which governs pre – contractual relations and of those that concern a contractual performance, as well as the contrast between terms that are expressly codified for the intrusion of a duty of good faith. In light of this intricacy, Longmore LJ took on the role of understanding the criticisms that the courts have had with upholding a promise to negotiate, he pointed out three main arguments; one of them being that the obligation is an agreement to agree and this is too uncertain to enforce.. However, he dismissed this argument by stating that is carries little weight because the obligation on the facts was an express obligation in a contract that was otherwise enforceable. By arguing, these main points Longmore LJ has narrowed the vagueness, and this is best shown in the comparison of Walford v Miles and Petromec Inc v Petroleo, in the Walford case the contract was still to come into the effect of the good faith arrangement as it was still in the pre – negotiation stage, the contract was never concluded. However, in Petromec, it was clear that it was not just a bare agreement to negotiation, as it was a complex contract drafted by their lawyers. This case, is a crucial turning point in relation to promises to negotiate in good faith, as it maintains party autonomy and freedom of contract, which as mentioned is fundamental to Englands commercial environment, therefore, allows for a consistent and coherent standard of how express terms are upheld by the courts. <nl><nl><nl>The Quota To Satisfy<nl>Shaker v Visajet, was yet another case that was consistent with the way the Courts uphold express promises to negotiate in good faith. In this case, there was a promise to ‘proceed in good faith’ as well as ‘use reasonable endeavours’ to agree a documentation pursuant to the purchase of an aircraft. Teare J stated that there was no binding legal obligation based on the promise. The reason for this was because there was ‘no objective criteria’, that the court was able to decide whether the party acted unreasonably.  This further enhances the distinction using Petromec , because in the case, there was sufficient objective criteria to make the promise enforceable. However, Shaker, meant that the courts devised a test in order to see if the express promises to negotiate is enforceable; the test requires two questions to be satisfied. The first criteria to meet is, ‘is there a certainty of object?’, this relates to clarity in what the negotiation was set out to achieve e.g. responding to a change in the circumstances. The second is ‘ are there sufficient objective criteria to determine what a good faith negotiation looks like in the context of this particular contract?’ This criteria relates to the idea that the Courts should be able to look at the contract and have the exact information to uncover, what the negotiation should look like in good faith. These cases all draw to the same conclusion that promises to negotiate in good faith should be upheld and is attempted to be done so by the Courts by using precedence, the courts should not avoid enforceability due to some vagueness, on how the term is to be upheld in practical contexts.<nl><nl>Upholding the contract leading too much involvement<nl>Parties requiring terms to be upheld and enforced necessitates a court to work out what a good faith negotiation looks like in that contract, in fact it is vital to do so, because it is the only way to conclude if there has been a breach or not. There is too much vagueness surrounding the good faith negotiation, which inevitably leads to the Courts having to fill in the blanks, in essence leading them to ‘make’ the contracts for the parties. In fact, this interpretation is considered to take up more judicial time than all other areas of the law of contract put together. Although, Lord Hoffman came up with five principles governing how the courts should interpret written contracts, there was a lot of backlash for this as it was ‘It was said to generate uncertainty because it appeared to widen the circumstances in which the judges could depart from the ‘natural and ordinary meaning’ of the words used by the parties.’ The underlying issue is that, regardless, of how precise the terms are, it will inevitably lead to courts getting too involved in interpreting the contract and assuming what the parties meant instead of what they actually wrote. This in turn generates too much uncertainty and threatens the stability of the commercial environment.<nl><nl>                                       Alternatives to solve uncertainty<nl>Although, a common option for both parties is to include an arbitration, which is an alternate way of settling a dispute outside of courts, however, this has been criticised because the existence of the arbitration obligation specifically incorporated into clause itself indicates strongly that the parties were not intending to retain their freedom to agree or disagree according to their perceived interests. More importantly, as highlighted in the Emirates Trading and Associated British Ports, it leads to satellite litigation, meaning the parties go to Court arguing about not the specific breach of the contract but a separate matter arising from this, in the Emirates Trading case, it was about whether the good faith negotiation term was in fact enforceable. Satellite litigation is undesirable and in fact takes up the Courts resources and arguably, \"tends not to help with either expedition or the saving of expense and perhaps more than anything leads to disproportionality.\" Ironically, the very reason why the express promise to negotiate was avoid long-drawn-out dispute and going to court by resolving them through friendly discussions of good faith. Thus, indicating that going to court may lead to better solutions for the parties, simultaneously, altering the position and standpoint of the traditional view held by the English courts.<nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>To conclude, express promises to negotiate in good faith is upholding, although it has been consistent and the requirements have been made unambiguous through case law and the enforceability by the Courts have also been constant, aiding the reliability and validity. However, the issue with the Court enforcing the express terms is that, they have to work out the good faith in the negotiation, but by doing this it means that the courts are at high risk of making the parties contracts for them. This creates the worry that the commercial stability in England would be threatened because it means party autonomy is not at the priority, as well, as freedom of contract. Both of these element are considered to be central to the English law, in relation to commercial law.

I intend to discuss the psychoanalytic and biological perspective.<nl><nl>The biological perspective focuses on the nature within the nature vs nurture debate. The debate is the question whether our behaviour as humans is predetermined by genetics or is governed by our environment(prenatal and during one’s life). The perspective focuses on the significance of genes, brain physiology and neurochemistry.Overall,it examines; emotions, thoughts and behaviour in a physical point of view. <nl><nl>The first assumption of the biological approach is brain physiology affects behaviour and thoughts;the brain has many different parts and these parts affecting different behaviours. This is localisation of brain function- this has been supported by early research e.g Wernicke and Broca as well as more recent methods such as neuro brain imaging.Broca's area is found in the left inferior frontal gyrus and Wernicke's area is located in the left posterior superior temporal gyrus. The Broca’s area discovered by Paul Broca in 1861 (Dronkers et al, 2007) is related to the production of speech damage to this area results in Broca’s aphasia, sufferers will struggle in terms of producing speech but not comprehension. Wernicke’s area, discovered by Carl Wernicke 1864 (Robson et al, 2014) is responsible for understanding of speech, someone with Wernicke’s aphasia will struggle understanding of speech but will be able to speak, though speech may not be fluent. Showing that brain physiology does affect behaviour and there are different parts responsible. Neurotransmitter activity also affect behaviour  biological psychologists have used research on mental disorders to support this, for example the dopamine hypothesis suggests that schizophrenia is caused by too much dopamine or too much dopamine receptors. (Desbonnet, in Handbook of Behavioral Neuroscience, 2016)<nl><nl>The second assumption is the idea that behaviour is inherited, twin studies are used  to study this as well as adoption studies, as you’re more likely able to tell the significance of genes (twin studies).Research on mental disorders such as depression has supported this; concordance rates of major depressive disorder amongst 177 twins between 1948 and 1976 showed that monozygotic twins (identical) had a rate of 46% whereas dizygotic twins had a rate of 20% (McGuffin P, Katz R, Watkins S, Rutherford J.1996).Showing the significance genes component in behaviour and how as humans we are genetically disposed to acting a certain way or having particular disorders. <nl><nl>As the biological approach looks at psychology in a physical light, it is regarded to be the most scientific approach, using empirical methods to gather information and leading them to have quantitative results. The approach’s use of brain scanning techniques which include; electroencephalography (EEG), magnetic resonance imaging(fMRI) and event related potentials (ERP)(Xue et al, 20120). These have been proven effective and the activity of the brain can be successfully observed. Such techniques have been exceptionally useful, e.g on localisation of function, fMRI scans produce brain maps showing which parts of the brain are most active during a task, this is done by measuring the haemodynamic response to active neurons. Where there are more active neurons indicates the parts of the brain which are active.<nl><nl>In addition, the approach has been successful in terms of its therapies, the use of drug therapy and its effect on one’s biochemistry. As the biological explanation for schizophrenia states that the cause of the disorder is too much dopamine or too much dopamine receptors, drug treatments follow from this. An example is the effect of antipsychotic drugs on patients with schizophrenia; both typical and anti typical antipsychotics (AAP) work by affecting dopamine and serotonin activity in the brain- however AAPs are more widely used as they have less side effects on patients. Clozapine, is an example and blocks serotonin, but AAPs in general work by affecting D2 receptors in the limbic system, in contrast to typical antipsychotics they do not affect other receptors. Research shows that both the first generation and second generation antipsychotics have positive effects on reducing schizophrenia symptoms. Earlier research by Awad and Voruganti et al. showed how 85% of patients benefited from taking lurasidoe, an AAP.(Awad et al, 2016).The psychoanalytic perspective introduced was introduced by Sigmund Freud. He put forward the idea that human behaviour is influenced by unconscious thoughts that we are actually not able to access however, these unconscious thoughts affect behaviour.This leads to an internal conflict within the mind. Additionally, Freud believed all behaviour and feelings within adults is a consequence of childhood experiences whether these experiences are remembered or not they ‘live’ in the unconscious part of the mind. The perspective takes into account the both sides of the nature and nurture debate as the drives within us are innate and ultimatley we are born with them e.g hunger, sex and aggression. However the fact childhood experiences affect adult behaviour, sides with nurture debate. <nl><nl>One of the main assumptions of the psychoanalytic perspective is the idea of a tripartite personality, Freud believed that all three develop at different stages in childhood. <nl>The id is the component of that we’re born with, it’s concerned with pleasure; food and sleep etc and seeks immediate gratification.It is described as ‘selfish’. The ego develops after, within three years of life- this component is based on the reality principle, it makes realistic decisions. Last to develop around 5 years of age is the super-ego, this acts as the ‘conscience’ out of all the three parts, it rationalises with the ego’s decisions- it does this by instilling moral on the go, these morals are societal rules but also the values that we have been brought up with influenced by parents. Complying with these rules results in feelings of pleasure and pride whereas going against these internalised rules leads to feelings of displeasure and guilt. These three parts of the psyche (personality) cause an internal conflict(Schultz&amp;Schultz, 2011, page 288) so Freud put forward the idea of Defense Mechanisms, these are five ways which we use to reduce the internal conflict:repression, denial, projection, displacement and sublimation. Projection is a common one where someone almost places their embarrassment onto someone else; for example, for example when you have disappointed someone and you are aware you are in the wrong, you may decide to blame them when they have done nothing wrong. Sublimation on the other hand is thought to have positive effects; this is where the negative feelings(the id’s demands) are turned into positive actions, someone who may have control issues and  may decide to be a store manager to exert this power on others in a positive way.<nl><nl>Another assumption of the psychoanalytic approach is that humans develop through Psychosexual stages during the progression of the tripartite personality. He proposed 5 stages; oral, anal, phallic, latency and genital. Within each stage, issues could arise- the issue is fixation. This idea of fixation can lead to psychological issues in adult feelings and behaviour. The oral stage is between birth and the age of an infant depends on the caregiver for feeding and the infant depends on feeding for gratification. The issue is arises when weaning becomes a problem, the caregiver should allow the infant to become less dependent, if this does not happen fixation occurs. As a consequence in adult life the individual will have dependency issues, for example clingy behaviour in relationships, additionally they’ll develop issues such as binge drinking, smoking or nail biting. The anal stage is during this stage of 18mths to  3.5 yeas. Parents should encoruage children to be able to control (urinating and defacating), if this is not overall a positive experience this will lead to either an anal retentive personality as an adult or an anal explusive personality. An anal-retentive individual would be very rigid and also very obsessed with cleanliness, this is because their caregiver during the anal stage may have been very strict and not providing any praise. The opposite would be an anal-expulsive adult who is diorganised and untidy; a consequence of lax guidance from the caregiver during the anal stage. The genital stage is the final stage, starting from puberty and into adulthood (Elkatawneh, Freud’s Psycho-Sexual Stages of Development, 2013) <nl><nl>Both the approaches have proven to be very applicable and have had application within the clinical field, this is a huge similarity between the two. The psychoanalytic perspective has produced therapies such as psychoanalysis.This  attempts to delve into the unconscious(feelings,memories or motives that are repressed) of the psyche by analysing the individual’s present behaviour. The individual is encouraged to look back into childhood for any trauma or occurrences that are affecting the present behaviour. It is usually used to treat depression, emotional disturbances etc. Similarly, the biological perspective has assisted in treating similar disorders such as depression through antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) this is a medication that increases serotonin, reducing depression symptoms.(Jain, Neurology Medlink 2009)<nl><nl>A difference between the approaches is that the psychoanalytic is not scientific whereas the biological is a scientifically credible approach as it uses scientific ways of  measurement; collecting data which empirical e.g through brain scanning techniques this means measurements are objective. Studies are conducted in controlled lab settings which are replicable and reliable, as a result this makes the approach a nomothetic as the results can be generalised and laws can be made from results. In contrast the psychoanalytic approach is not falsifiable. Freud’s assumptions can not be proved wrong, as they can not be scientifically tested or measured. This results in the psychoanalytic perspective being idiographic as there’s emphasis on one’s personal experience he also focused on case studies meaning results can’t be generationalised to produce laws as they’re too subjective.<nl><nl>To summarize, both perspectives are deterministic; the biological suggesting human behaviour is a result of our genetics,brain physiology and neuro chemistry therefore we have no free will. The psychoanalytical suggests behaviour is a consequence of upbringing as the psych is completely developed by six years of age, so both do not take into account the role of free will. Furthermore, the two perspectives continue to impact society in a positive way improving understanding of behaviour.", "r <addr11_FN>,<nl><nl>I hope you are well.

{"id": "3b5a8025-4f06-42db-8737-82b3eb3c8a18", "discourse_types": ["essay", "text_message"], "pair": ["This essay will look to answer the question above, ‘To what extent does sport foster and reproduce a hyper-consumerist culture?’. Hyper-consumerism refers to ‘the consumption of goods for non-functional purposes and the associated significant pressure to consume those goods, exerted by modern capitalist society, as those goods shape one’s identity’ (Wikipedia, 2020), in simpler forms, ‘a consumerism for the sake of consuming’ (Lunning, F., 2014). There are a number of ways that the theory of hyper-consumerism can be applied to the subject of sport and sports relation to hyper-consumerism. However, there are a number of ways that sport can be considered as not fostering and reproducing hyper-consumerism and instead an area affected by hyper-consumerism. <nl><nl>There are a number of highly popular professional sports that over the last 3 decades have seen the change of consumerism within the professional sport. Hyper-consumerism in a number of professional sports. One professional sport where there has been an abundance of growth in consumerism and profitability is professional football. The Premier League teams of England are projected to pull in £5.4bn in the 202021 season (Deloitte, 2020). With £1.35bn (25%) of this coming from commercial business for the Premier League clubs. The Premier League generates the most revenue out of all the top 5 European football leagues by roughly £1.5bn over the closest league, Spain at £3.38bn. The scale of these figures show the high expenditure within football leagues but especially the Premier League. It also shows the size of the commercial brands of the Premier League teams. Specifically the annual revenue of the big 6 Premier League teams totalling £4.13bn (Sports Pro Media, 2020). This revenue causes high expenditure on transfers and wages for players. This lavish spending fosters a lifestyle that is presented to fans and these fans want to be a part of whether its buying a jersey of the team they support or buying a season ticket to watch their team every weekend. These actions are a perfect example of hyper-consumerism culture with these goods being non-functional and possess a significant pressure in the supporters life and take control of their lives when the games are being played. <nl><nl>Although hyper-consumerism does play a role within sports, as presented above, however, is the growth of revenues within football fostered by hyper-consumerism not the other way round? Hyper-consumerism is a theory that has been around longer than the growth in revenues for sports with its close association with globalisation and cultural homogenisation (McGregor, S., 2007). With this considered if there was a lack of globalisation and cultural homogenisation would we see the high revenue of the top global sporting leagues such as  the NFL, NBA, MLB and the Premier League, which all are valued between £5bn and £11bn (AP Sports Editor, 2020). Without the human nature of greed that causes hyper-consumerism would we instead see these leagues having significantly lower revenue. This is just one factor that could suggest in my opinion that hyper-consumerism fosters sports and the growth of sports. It can also be considered that hyper-consumerism and sports are actually symbiotic, in which they work in a close relationship as one grows the other grows and vice-versa. <nl> <nl>Another factor that supports the idea of sports fostering and reproducing hyper-consumerism is that of the growing expenditure of households on sports. According to a study by Sheffield Hallam University, the average household expenditure on sports in 2002 was £11.38, however, as of 2018 the average household expenditure on sports was £76.80 (Gov.uk, 2019).  This is a 674% increase in expenditure over 16 years or 42% per year. This tremendous growth in expenditure is similar to the growth in revenue of the most popular UK sporting league, the Premier League, which over 16 years saw its revenues grow from £1.25bn (Deloitte, 2003) to £5.4bn, a growth of 432% or 27% . This shows as a professional sport league grows so does the expenditure by a household. Thus showing evidence of how sport can reproduce and foster a hyper-consumerism culture which is clearly evident in the UK. This culture has significantly grown in the UK over the last two decades and I will look at further into this essay. <nl><nl>Although there is evidence of hyper-consumerism having a relationship to sport, there is also evidence of hyper-consumerism being caused by the growth of technology. A prime example of this is the hyper-consumerism of the United Arab Emirates. The UAE has seen a growth of hyper-consumerism with the growth of technology within the country’s economy (Kazim, A., 2018). With an abundance of mega malls and the growth of internet shopping the culture in UAE over the last 50 years has transferred from traditional markets to a hyper-consumer culture of luxury global brands. The growth in this culture in the UAE is seen further with the growth of the country’s GDP per capita which, as of 2019, totaled $69,900 (Societe Generale, 2019). This is a stark contrast to 1975 when the GDP per capita was at $26,847 (World Bank, 2019). These statistics suggest a substantial growth in the economy which has come with a growth in consumerism. This suggests the theory that the main cause of hyper-consumerism is the growth of an economy. Further evidence of this is the lack of sport participation in the UAE this hyper-consumerist market exists in a culture in which roughly only 6% of the population plays a sport over 3 times a week. Reinforcing that instead of the sports being played fostering hyper-consumerism instead its the growth of globalisation and technology fostering hyper-consumerism. Ultimately, this shows that hyper-consumerism can exist without a large presence of sport within the economy. <nl><nl>This hyper-consumerist culture that has been seen in the United Arab Emirates is prominently the whole world over. However, there is clear and specific sport  that can be given as evidence for fostering and reproducing hyper-consumerism. One such sport is basketball and specifically the NBA (National Basketball Association). A prime example within the sport is the Air Jordan brand, owned by Nike and named after the critically acclaimed greatest player of all time, Michael Jordan. The Air Jordan brand, launched in 1984, in 2019, had revenues totalling $3.1 billion which made up 8% of Nike’s revenues in the same year (Forbes, 2020). This along with the revenue of the NBA itself of $8.4 billion shows the massively consumer nature of the NBA in the US (ESPN, 2020). Within the NBA the most popular consumer good is team jerseys, the average price of these is $110, approx. £81 (The Street, 2020). This high priced consumer good along with the cost of attending an NBA game of roughly $89. This fits perfectly the nature of goods that are typical of a hyper-consumerist culture described in the introduction. These goods are not something that is functional but people want and purchase for their lives to fit in with the culture. <nl><nl>Hyper-consumerism is caused by a number of economic factors and the sports economic growth is instead down to the existence of hyper-consumerism. An economic factor is globalisation, with the growing number of accessible non-functional goods hyper-consumerism has become a causal byproduct. This can be seen in sports as seen above with the English Premier League growing to revenues of £5.4bn in 2020. With the league being watched globally in 188 of 193 countries (Premier League, 2019). Without globalisation there would not be abundant accessibility of sports to consumers. With the growth of commercial sports media on the internet in places such as Youtube, with 79% of users watching sports on the platform (Youtube, 2020). Globalisation of markets has caused  hyper-consumerism and greater accessibility to sports that would not be possible without globalisation. . <nl><nl>Previously I have discussed the growing sporting culture and spectator sports in the UK and its role in fostering hyperconsumerism. This is an area that has seen significant growth and can be used as evidence. On the subject of spectator sports, on average in the UK expenditure by spectators is £54 per person (not including ticket price) (Sports England, 2019). This shows sports fostering hyper-consumerism as when attending these events spectators are spending money for non-functional purposes. Furthermore, the UK sporting goods market is expected to have grown by 3.5% in 2020 despite the COVID-19 pandemic (Ibis World, 2020) . Largely caused by the increase of people exercising during the national lockdowns ordered by the UK Government. This being reinforced by the statistics, from Sport England, that 63% of people saying that they exercise over 3 days a week in the first National Lockdown. This shows that even in a time of economic negativity with the UK economy shrinking by 3.4% (PWC, 2020) there was still significant consumer spending on sport showing the level of consumers wants and needs to spend on the non-functional goods or services. This growth in the market even in the pandemic is far greater than other non-functional goods in this time and show the nature of sports fostering and reproducing hyper-consumerism. <nl><nl>Throughout this essay I have compared aspects in which that sport both does foster and reproduce hyper-consumerism but also doesn’t. The aspects that sport shows to foster and reproduce is through the growth of popular leagues such as the English Premier League and these top leagues promoting a lifestyle, the growing of UK household expenditure on watching professional sports, sporting good brands promoted through professional sports such as the NBA and the Air Jordan brand, expenditure on attending spectator sports and purchases at these events. All these aspects promote a clear message that sports play a role in hyper-consumerism at the bare minimum. Whether sport ‘fosters and reproduces’ hyper-consumerism is highly contestable. Shown by the evidence presented hyper-consumerism can exist and grow without an overarching presence of sport, as seen with the UAE in which the average GDP per capita has grown from $26,847 in 1975 to $69,900 in 2019. This staggering growth in GDP per capita has caused a growth in the consumerist culture which is highly focused on luxury consumer brands. This hyper-consumerist market exists in a culture in which roughly only 6% of the population plays a sport over 3 times a week. In conclusion, I think that, firstly, sport can foster and reproduce hyper-consumerism. However, I believe that hyper-consumerism does not need sports to grow as shown with the case of the United Arab Emirates, although this is a rarity and to fully determine how common of an occurrence this can be further research needs to be done. Finally, although sport does foster hyper-consumerism it is only possible with globalisation and instead globalisation is the major foster and reproducer of hyper-consumerism and sports is an area that is consumed by the hyper-consumerist culture we have.

I am studying <course>, and would prefer to complete a placement in the <subject1> field. I have thought about it being in the area of Government, for example anything in the civil service. However, it is most likely that a civil service opportunity would be in <city1> and due to high living and travel costs, I’d rather stay closer to home. I have heard about democratic placements and wondered if I could have more information on this. I have also looked at charities and non- profit organizations but like most students, would find a paid placement more ideal. I was wondering, what paid placement opportunities have past <subject1> students found? Another point is that anything in journalism, or broadcasting, that would suit the <subject2> part of degree is something I would consider. For example, an  opportunity in the BBC, as they have an location in <city2>. I am also considering doing a half work placement, half studying abroad, but only in Europe. However, would like more information on how this would work. Specifically, for me and my degree, if I wanted to attend a partner university of <university>, what course would I have to pursue?, how would this work alongside my current degree? Overall, I am searching for a local work placement easy for me to commute to (from <city2>), or a UK work placement where living expenses are not too high. I defiantly want a paid opportunity, and in an area of <subject1>. However, as previously mentioned I am open to an opportunity providing a background of <subject2>, and a part time studying abroad opportunity. Please can you get back to me soon, as I am starting to worry about  my options, and the current time frame of not being on campus has made me feel anxious that I will not find the right opportunity for me.

{"id": "6711f1be-0bd4-4352-af54-c9d02c58e4b8", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Abstract<nl>This experiment was conducted to investigate the alpha inhibition hypothesis (AIH) using a cued visual attention task. The hypothesis for this experiment were that participants alpha range activities would be higher in the cue left than cue right when recording from the left of the parietal lobe. Participants were cued to expect stimuli on the right or left. The results were as hypothesised: when recording alpha range activity from the left parietal lobe amplitudes were higher in the left cue than right cue condition. In conclusion alpha activity can be modulated by attention and visual stimuli is processed on the opposite side stimuli is presented. The data were valid in his experiment.<nl>Introduction<nl>AIH is where high alpha is indicative of inhibition and disengagement of task irrelevant brain areas (Klimesch et al., 2007). However, alpha is reduced in task relevant brain areas this means that alpha activity can be modulated by attention. Visual stimuli is processed contralaterally, so stimuli presented on the right will be processed on the left and stimuli presented on the left will be processed on the right. Handel at al (2001) explains that higher alpha power contralateral to the unattended side means that unattended stimuli is associated with an increase in alpha activity, that therefore means alpha frequencies are higher if stimuli are not paid attention to. Sauseng et al. (2015) study, participants saw a cross at the centre of the screen for 34ms, an arrow showing which hemifield a target would appear was presented at the centre. There was an interval of 600-800ms. White bars on black background were presented for 50ms. Sauseng et al. (2015) had similar results to Handel in that there was less alpha activity on the side of the brain stimuli were processed. This shows that there is more alpha activity in the parietal lobe on the side where stimuli is not processed.<nl>In this experiment a partial replication of Sauseng et al (2005) was conducted. This was recorded on the left parietal lobe (P3) as he found that parietal sites were good indicators of alpha in relation to attention. Therefore, the hypothesis for this experiment is that alpha amplitudes (in microvolts) would be higher in the cue left than cue right when recording from P3 on the left of the parietal lobe. <nl><nl><nl><nl>METHOD<nl>Participants<nl>There were 39 participants initially, but one participants' data was removed as data was only available for one of the two conditions therefore 38 participants data was collected and analysed. Participants were from a volunteer sample of undergraduate Psychology students. <nl>Design<nl>The design of this study was a within subject’s design as each participant saw both cue left and right conditions. The independent variable was cue location with 2 levels left and right. The dependent variable was alpha amplitudes in microvolts.<nl>Materials<nl>The materials used for this experiment was a Biopac MP36 to collect EEG data and receive event markers, EEG electrodes, AC Cream to improve conductivity, Everi cream, PsychoPy software used for running the experiment and send event markers to Biopac through a stimtracker device. Finally, stimulus, small and large white bars to be displayed on a black background (as shown in figure 1a and 1b) were used as well as cues: left and right arrows as shown like this &lt; and &gt;.<nl><figure><nl>Procedure<nl>Participant’s gave consent prior to taking part in this experiment. A Biopac was set up to record alpha range activity (8-13Hz) and to receive left and right cue event markers. The sampling rate was 1000 Hz. The electrodes were then placed on the head using the 1020 electrode placement system. 3 electrodes, the active electrode is the site being measured and will be attached to region P3. The reference electrode is attached to Fz as it provides a comparison. Finally earth electrode reduces electrical activity and will be attached to the forehead near the hairline.<nl>The impedance was checked and was below 10 kOhms.There were 12 practice trials in total where the ISI were fixed, and participants were given feedback. The experimental trials were the same as the practice trials but there were 20 blocks of 4 trials (cued right small bar, cued left small bar, cued right large bar, and cued left large bar) and 80 trials in total with random time interval. Experimenters told participants that they would see cues with an arrow presented for 34ms and to expect a stimulus.There was an interval between 600 and 800ms. The stimuli either large or small bar were shown for 50ms. Experimenters told participants to respond on the keyboard with ‘s’ for small or ‘l’ for large. Different event markers were sent at stimulus onset during the experimental but not practice trials. The event markers allowed us to identify exactly when stimulus appeared on the screen. 200ms before stimulus onset were isolated to examine the effect of the cues on brain activity. Participants were debriefed and had a right to withdraw data. The experimenter cleaned the participant and analysed the data. <nl>Results<nl>Data Treatment <nl>The period of 200ms before stimulus onset was looked at and analysed. To get the raw 9-13 Hz Alpha EEG to the average data event markers were sent from psychoPy to identify when stimuli were presented. The alpha amplitudes in the 200ms before stimulus presentation after arrow cues had been shown. Rectifying the raw data turns all the minus values into plus values giving an average deviation from 0 in microvolts regardless of whether the alpha activity was excitatory or inhibitory. Averaging over 50 samples minimising outliers and extreme values, smoothing the curves making it easier to interpret the data. The data is then known as Rectified and averaged Alpha Amplitudes (RAAA).<nl>Analysis<nl><table><nl>Table 1. Shows that median alpha amplitudes in P3 were higher in the cue left than cue right condition 200ms before the stimulus was presented, A Shapiro-Wilk test showed the values for the cue left and cue right conditions: (W= 0.827, n =38, p &lt;.001) and (W=0.846, n=38, p &lt;.001) The data were not normally distributed (p &lt; .05) therefore a Wilcoxon signed ranks test was done to analyse the data. This showed that the difference was significant (T = 566, n = 38, p &lt; .005). <nl>Discussion<nl>The research hypothesis was supported in that alpha activity increased at P3 when participants were cued to the left hemifield as opposed to the right hemifield 200ms before stimulus was presented. These results were consistent with alpha inhibition hypothesis as high alpha amplitudes and disengagement of task irrelevant brain areas (Klimesch et al., 2007) on the ipsilateral side where cue was presented. Stimuli that was presented on the right was processed on the left and stimuli presented on the left was processed on the right consistent with Handel at al (2001) research.<nl>A methodological problem that might have affected the results is doing an experiment in a distracting environment as noise can disrupt attention and concentration when this experiment is a visual attention task. This experiment was conducted in a room full of people also conducting their experiment which accumulated to loud noise. Spencer et al (2000) also concludes that noisy environments are known to influence cognitive processing. Noise can be very distracting leading to interference making the results vary in validity. Another methodological problem that could occur is varying levels of impedance. Strict adherence to impedance of &lt; 10kOhms is required here, a higher or lower impedance can make the experiment invalid.<nl> In conclusion the differences were in the anticipated direction empirically and theoretically consistent with other researchers' results suggesting that, despite some of the issues, the data were valid as it supports the AIH theory of stimuli presented on the right will be processed on the left and vice versa. Overall, this means that this study was reliable making it replicable as it follows the same results as Sauseng et al’s (2005) study.", "far as im aware, the group havent met.

The strategy will focus on passing laws to criminalise abusers and to formalise the industry by establishing policy surrounding working pay and overall job protection. This paper will begin by outlining background information surrounding the role of house girls and the challenges they face.  <nl>The main body of the paper will then express the previous strategies used, as well as new strategies that can be implemented to alleviate the problem. This will be compared to the context of South African legislation to show their success in emulating such an issue. By including goals, theories and potential allies this paper will provide an effective solution to curve the rate of abuse towards house girls. <nl>Lastly the conclusion will end with summarising all of the findings that seek to combat the issue at hand. <nl><nl>What is a house girl?<nl>According to Oxford dictionary, a house girl is \"defined as a female slave who works in a house (now historical); or any young female domestic servant or employee, especially in some former British dependencies. (Later)\"<nl>For centuries many women and girls have taken on domestic work in the role of domestic house girls as a means for escaping extreme poverty. This industry is normalised in less developed countries especially within Africa. In Nigeria, the most densely populated African country, house girls are particularly popular however due to the lack of workers’ rights, desperation of employees and ineffective laws to protect workers, many girls are prone to maltreatment. This ranges from poor living conditions, sexual abuse and a lack of basic human rights as a whole. <nl><nl>Causes of the problem.<nl>House girls in Nigeria are usually employed by upper- and middle-class families with disposable income to spare and girls as young as 10 start working in such roles. The fundamental reason why this practise is widespread is due to poverty, with \"females from low-income households expected to work, often to contribute to the economic sustenance of the family thus playing the role as the breadwinner\" (Nwaubani 2017). Many people from rural areas travel into main cities such as Lagos in search of better employment opportunities and means of livelihood. <nl> Furthermore, in Nigeria, there is a large disparity between the education level that boys and girls receive, with many girls failing to have access to adequate education past a certain age. <nl>This is exemplified through UNESCO Institute for Statistics 2015 where female adult literacy rates (ages 15 and above) in Nigeria was 59.4% in comparison to the male rate of 74.4%. This disparity is a main contributor to why many young women become house girls. Csapo, M (1981) explains how, in particular, in the northern region, Nigerian women are considered secondary citizens therefore education is not so much a priority. Parents, especially that of Muslim heritage are reluctant to send their girls to school due to fear of moral laxity from the westernised teachings.<nl>These customs and beliefs contribute to the disrespect women face whilst at work. The patriarchal society that Nigeria operates on further opens up doors for abuse this is exemplified through feminist theory which view \"oppression of women and patriarchal privilege as a mechanism for violence against women\" (Napikoski 2020). Women who seek to become house girls at whatever educational level should be given the same rights as any other worker. <nl>Furthermore, many house girls lack a job with good working conditions and security due to the lack of labour laws being enforced. This under- the-radar market allows for women to work under exhausting conditions subject to poor pay and long hours and constant insults from their employers. Girls who work for over 8 hours a day are significantly more likely to be sexually assaulted due to the time spent at work being greater.<nl>Media platforms such as Nollywood also depict house girls as poor, needy and constantly faced with maltreatment. This depiction exemplifies itself in reality.<nl>The maltreatment of house girls is also compounded by the fact that the house girl industry is currently informal. There are no regulations and requirements for any worker thus many women remain at the mercy of their boss, simply leaving women vulnerable to crime and exploitative employment.<nl>Children who are a part of this informal sector are especially at risk of sexual exploitation creating long term problems such as unwanted pregnancies and psychosocial trauma. (International Bank for Reconstruction and Development 2019)<nl>Domestic slavery makes $18 billion alone in Africa and entry into this informal economy has significantly increased in recent times, the house girl economy thrives because of ready availability of services for the market. This in turn cuts through all necessary checks and procedures which protect female workers. Employers further defend themselves by saying these girls are better off working in homes, rather than on the street.<nl>Due to this industry occurring in people’s private household, boundaries between the public and private sphere and the states involvement becomes hard to cross, nevertheless, this is an issue that must be addressed as it is an infringement on human rights and these unfortunate experiences truly manifest themselves in the everyday life of women. <nl><nl>Previous strategies.<nl>Pressure from outsider groups have called for the police and government to protect female workers including house girls due to the trafficking they are prone to. <nl>In 2004, the Nigerian government created the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP), an anti-trafficking agency, designed to tackling trafficking. Between 2003-2017, they were successful in recovering over 3000 victims. Furthermore in 2015 Nigeria altered their trafficking laws to elevate penalties for offenders and criminalise those who employed children under 12 in domestic labour. Whilst human rights activists such as The National Human Rights Commission, work with the police and NAPTIP to secure prosecutions and provide shelter and aid for victims, the issue still persists. <nl>At present there are national legislative inconsistencies towards the minimum age to work (2015 US Labour Department report). The Child Rights Act prohibits those under 18 from working yet the Labour Act sets the minimum age of employment at 12. This elucidates the inconsistency of the legislative system in protecting female workers.<nl>Ultimately this ambiguousness needs to be removed or amended in order to tackle violence against house girls.<nl><nl>Proposed strategies<nl>1. Registration of employees.<nl>Providing domestic help is not the main cause of abuse as across countries, where there is less domestic abuse, this is seen with the likes of au-pairs, nannies, maids etc. such as in the UK.<nl>Chinelo Ezenwaadding, a female rights activist, claims \"the house help industry can be a positive thing because you get to help others, but it should be regulated and there should be laws governing the treatment of maids.\" Therefore, by establishing employment policy standards we can reach a greater environment for workers and tackle violence cases. I believe this is the most utilitarian approach.<nl>In Nigeria, there is a high number of house girls that have not been recognised as official workers, thus feed into the informal economy.  This presents several problems and avoidable situations such as limited accessibility to any legal rights if needed. <nl>\"The informal economy represents a multi‐facetted and spatially diverse phenomenon\" (Fajana 2008). However, through regulation of this informal work, advantages will arise such as industrial peace and order. Therefore, every female of the legal working age needs to be put on a governmental system acknowledging house girls as established employees. Workers must be registered in order to start working providing this switch from an informal to formal sector will reduce the chances of maltreatment through ending under aged workers and exploitation towards females. <nl>Accountability for any unethical matters can be upheld and under-the-radar crimes which were once hard to record can now be accounted for. By implementing this policy the economy will be regulated and VAW reduced.<nl><nl>2. Establishing a living minimum wage.<nl>The Capitalist Entrepreneurial Theory (Schumpeter 1942) aims to give an explanation behind inequality and poverty claiming \"the payment of meagre wage rates, as well as unfair, poor and irritating  working  conditions, are  means  of exploiting  the masses of  workers  and excessive, illustrating the constant cycle of poverty for these working women\". <nl>However this needs to be dismantled through giving a basic living salary that workers can survive on and is fairly reflected through the work they do. According to Naira Land Forum, \"house girls are paid from as little as 15,000 to 30,000 naira equating to £29.64-59.27 a month\".<nl>This contradicts with the monthly cost of living, which according to Statisais, is 43,000 naira thus illustrating how female workers are prone to no personal growth opportunities. Many of these women have economic responsibilities leaving them no choice but to work even for a minimum wage. Poverty is a primary risk factor that renders women and girls vulnerable to sex trafficking\" (PJI 2018)<nl>\"The growing labour force of this informal sector means that informal economy workers accept wages below the legal minimum levels\" (Anyanwu, 1994) this effects house girls, which in essence means that employment contacts between both employee and employer must be established, setting out hours of work and legal workers’ pay . This will reduce any form of financial abuse and studies imply that the best approach to lessen violence against women is to combine economic empowerment and gender equity efforts.<nl>This must be made universal for all working women and government must intervene to enabling this is established.<nl>England has successfully demonstrated this with implementing contracts for au- pairs which state clear agreements on provisions regarding regulated working hours and pay. Nigeria must adapt this same approach to allow for female emancipation.<nl><nl>3. Establishing a skills workshop.<nl>A weak to non-existent system for protecting children from abuse is prevalent across Nigeria (Santos Pais 2014)<nl>A community based approach, which doesn’t allow the lack of education to be a hindrance to one’s progression, is an essential tool towards female independence. Through providing government funded, free access to vocational skills for house girl who have been abused, this safe space will equip females with a broad set of skills to prepare them for another job sector. This differs from conventional shelters in that it re-trains females -emphasising the importance of rehabilitation to go back into the world of work thus enabling them to generate income to sustain themselves and their families.<nl>This approach can be further recognised through government coalition -working with local churches and charities to bring awareness to this cause.  <nl><nl>4. Legal reform.<nl>South African legislators have showed commitment to addressing violence against women through passing the Domestic Violence Act in 1998 which introduced minimum sentences for rape and tightened bail requirements for those accused of rape. Through establishing a new Ministry for Women, Children and Persons with Disability this further denotes commitment to combatting violence against women and seeked to go against the cultural norms towards violence against women especially within private households were proof of abuse was often difficult obtain. As a result, significant contributions consisted of an increased conviction rate and a decrease in rape cases.<nl>\"In Nigeria among women aged 15–49 who have survived physical or sexual violence, 45% never got help or told anyone about the experience\" (NPC and ICF International 2014).Therefore the same legal and effective approaches must be taken by Nigerian policy makers to protect the rights of female house girls with potential threats that they could be faced with. A safe haven must be created for house girls who have been victimised thus providing severe consequences for criminals who perform and assist in abusing house girls. This unequivocally will drive down the cases of abuse. <nl>Structurally, a national framework protecting house girls from abuse should be established across Nigeria. Law enforcement officers are fundamentally necessary at the frontline of the criminal justice system. Their attitude and response towards violence against house girls can have a dramatic impact on ensuring the prevention of future violent acts and that the protection of victims are upheld. Violence against women and girls cannot be fought by women alone. Thus, law enforcement officers must be adequately trained and compensated so that they willing to do their jobs diligently.<nl>A South African project in 2000 successfully provided resources for facilitators to train prosecutors working in the area of VAW. This highlights that through time, investment and attitudinal changes Government efforts can be effective.<nl><nl>Conclusion.<nl>To conclude a strategy which focuses on legislative and humanitarian goals is crucial in reducing the rates of abuse. <nl>In co-operation with the Nigerian government the strategies presented in this paper will improve the standard of living for house girls and provide a modernised criminal justice system in which justice can be ratified if any women has been treated unfairly.<nl>It will also push house girls out of poverty alleviation and give women the tools to gain workers freedom, a concept that should be universal for all house girls across the globe. <nl>Ultimately the maltreatment of house girls in Nigeria is challenging to dismantle but efficient implementations of these proposed tactics will combat the maltreatment of house girls in Nigeria.", "lo sir, I am in your seminar class for <module> and I am just wondering if you could please read part of my essay for the assignment which is due.

{"id": "69a854cd-0c06-4656-a8ac-42b2895dcabb", "discourse_types": ["essay", "text_message"], "pair": ["ABSTRACT<nl>This experiment is a partial replication of Sauseng et al’s 2005 study where EEG recordings were taken from point P3 and alpha activity analysed from 200ms before stimuli onset based off a visual cueing task using arrows demonstrating cue left or cue right where participants had to indicate the correct response. As this experiment tested the Alpha Inhibition Hypothesis (AIH), a hypothesis was made stating that when recording from the left parietal lobe, alpha activity would be higher in the cue left conditions. The results of this experiment supported this hypothesis, highlighting that visual processing occurs contralaterally.<nl>INTRODUCTION<nl>This experiment was a partial replication of Sauseng et al’s (2005) experiment who used a visual cueing task where participants had to respond to stimuli presented on the screen following an arrow signalling which side stimuli would be presented. This was done to look at the effect of cues on alpha brain activity. Based on this, AIH states that there are higher alpha amplitudes in task irrelevant brain areas which is suggestive of alpha suppression in some visual cortex areas involved in active processing (Klimesch et al, 2007). Research produced by Sauseng et al (2005) found a significant effect of visual cue anticipation 200ms before stimuli being presented to 600ms post-stimuli presentation and within both valid and invalid trials, alpha suppression was seen in the side contralateral to cue.<nl>Given this, one would hypothesise that alpha amplitudes would be higher in the cue left conditions than in the cue right conditions, as activity was being measured from P3 in the left parietal lobe.<nl>METHOD<nl>PARTICIPANTS<nl>Initially, 39 undergraduate students were recruited through volunteer sampling however, one participants data had to be removed as it was incomplete, leaving 38 participants data to be analysed.<nl>DESIGN <nl>The design of the study was repeated measures. The independent variable is defined as the cue direction with two levels: left and right. The dependent variable is defined as the alpha amplitudes, measured in 𝜇V (microvolts).<nl>MATERIALS <nl>•PsychoPy to present the stimuli and send the event markers to the Biopac.<nl>•Biopac MP36 for recording alpha activity range amplitudes and receiving event markers from Psychopy<nl>•EEG electrodes used to record electrical activity.<nl>•Everi cream used to clean the scalp.<nl>•AC cream for applying electrodes on scalp.<nl>•Arrow cues (&lt;&gt;)<nl>•Small and large bar (see figures)<nl><figure><nl>PROCEDURE<nl>First, the experimenter briefed the participants on the nature of the study, and they gave their informed consent. They were then prepared for the experiment as the experimenter cleaned and placed the electrodes on the scalp using the 1020 locations (Trans-Cranial Technologies, 2012). The active wire was placed at the P3 region, the reference wire at the Fz region and the earth wire placed on the forehead near the hairline. Subsequently, impedance was checked and found to be below 10Kohms, and the Biopac was then set up to record raw EEG data at 0.5- 35Hz. The experimenter then set up a calculation channel to record the alpha frequency in the brain at the range of 8-13Hz and the digital channels were also set to receive event markers from Psychopy and Stimtracker. Event markers were then added after the Interstimulus Interval (ISI) routine and was sent by the software to the Biopac at stimulus onset allowing for an analysis of brain activity at that point in time. This time was 200ms immediately before the stimuli being shown and different event markers are used for cue left cue right conditions. The sampling rate of this experiment was 1000Hz.<nl>Participants then proceeded to sit at the computer where the practice experimental instructions were displayed on the screen. This stated that during the 12 practice trials, participants would see a cue indicating which side of the screen the stimuli will appear and should then proceed to press the appropriate key indicating their response following their attention to the ISI of the fixation cross. The cue was presented for 34ms, the (ISI) for between 600-800ms and the bars for 50ms. Once the practice trials were over, new instructions were presented on the screen indicating the actual experiment was to begin. The cues were presented in the centre of the screen constantly for both the practice and experimental trials however, for the practice trials, participants were provided with feedback whereas feedback was not provided for the actual experimental trials. There was a total of 80 trials (20 blocks of 4 trial types), presented in a randomised order.<nl>When the experiment was done, participants were cleaned of all adhesives and were fully debriefed on the nature of the experiment by the experimenter. Following this, data collected was proceeded to be analysed by the experimenter.<nl>RESULTS<nl>DATA TREATMENT<nl>The alpha channel first had to be duplicated and data transformed upon receiving waves from the EEG. This required the raw data received to be rectified meaning all negative values were converted to positive values, regardless of whether activity in the brain was excitatory or inhibitory. Data was then averaged over 38 samples to ensure extremities within the data set does not affect the data significantly. This also makes data easier to handle when it comes to interpreting the results. This then became the Rectified &amp; Averaged Alpha Amplitudes (RAAA) as all EEG data were amplified.<nl>ANALYSIS<nl>A Shapiro-Wilk test was used to determine which data analysis to use. This came back significant for both cue left (W=.83, N=38, P&lt;.001) and cue right conditions (W=.85, N=38, P&lt;.001). As p&lt;.05, the data is not normally distributed, so a non-parametric test T-Test of Wilcoxon signed ranks was used to analyse the data.<nl><table><nl>Table 1 shows that the median amplitude was higher in the cue left condition compared to the cue right condition. A Wilcoxon signed test showed that this difference was significant (T=566, N=38, P=.002), thus supporting the hypothesis. <nl>DISCUSSION<nl>The results of the experiment came back significant thus fitting in with the hypothesis stated earlier meaning that brain areas that are task irrelevant are associated with increased alpha inhibition.<nl>Though the results are consistent with the inhibition hypothesis, there could be several methodological issues that could have affected the results. First, the experiment was carried out amongst other experiments of the same kind. This may have created a distracting environment for the participants completing the experiment as other individuals in the room were in other activities. This goes together with artifacts. Confounding variables such as eye movements, pulse and sweat which could have affected EEG readings thus affecting the reliability of the experiment (Sazgar, 2019).<nl>This also leads to problems with the validity of the experiment. One cannot be sure that due to the conditions the experiment was conducted in, the results can be extrapolated to the public. The experiment was conducted on university students and results from Al Zoubi et al (2018) found that age affects EEG signals in the human brain thus concluding that older people are likely to have lower alpha amplitudes which has not been accounted for in this experiment. However, the experiment was still conducted on a diverse student body.<nl>Similarly, impedance may have also affected the EEG recordings. The higher the impedance value, the smaller the amplitude measurement. This is also likely to increase the skins potential artifact (Kapperman &amp; Luck, 2010).<nl>Regardless of slight concerns with the data collection and age range of the participants, overall, results of the experiment are valid and confirm the AIH thus concluding that the inhibition of alpha is indicative of attention due to stimuli being processed contralaterally.", "’t see what’s wrong in just sending it<new>Heyy<new>Mum just dropped some food outside your house x<new>No worries xx<new>Thank you!<new>You too xx<new>❤️❤️❤️<new>No way 😱<new>How short?<new>Yeah sure call when you can<new>Hey<new>I don’t know if your seen but <pers_FN>s mum has passed away<new>So sad<new>Loosing both parents aswell<new>She had <condition><new>And was in hospital<new>She might have had other problems idk<new>Yeah<new>Thank you!

{"id": "52fc9caf-4546-4101-a709-0be08f7c83fb", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["This essay will focus on how well FIFA have responded to the 2015 corruption scandal and an in-depth look into the measures they have since taken to prevent bribery being used within FIFA. By looking at different views and academic disciplines to critically evaluate if FIFA have done enough to prevent corruption and bribery continuing within their organisation.<nl><nl>Background:<nl>FIFA, an organisation people all over the world are familiar with. In 2002 213 countries broadcast the FIFA world cup making it the most watched event in television history. The reach and influence FIFA has is vast. FIFA is a non-profit organisation which describes itself as the international governing body of association football. FIFA was established in 1904 by 7 different nations. The global network and sensation surrounding FIFA Led them to generating $4.6 billion in 2018.<nl>In 2015 an investigation by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) lead to 14 people being indicted surrounding widespread allegations of corruption, wire fraud, racketeering, and money laundering within FIFA. There were allegations that $115 million in bribes were handed over to FIFA officials for several reasons. This case caused several arrests to be made in different countries across the world such as Australia, Columbia, Switzerland, Costa Rica, and Germany. This case has been ongoing for several years and allegations of corruption within FIFA have been circulating for many more. In 2002 a FIFA whistle-blower contacted a British journalist with allegations of corruption within FIFA. Later there was a book written by the same journalist (Andrew Jennings) documentary about the corruption and the World Cup this led to the FBI contacting Jennings. Since then more and more information from investigators and whistle-blowers has come to light about bribes and corruption going on within FIFA mainly regarding World Cup’s and where they will be held. Countries were bribing FIFA officials to accept their bid for the World Cup to be held in their country. The investigation has found out that there was bribery involved in Qatar’s successful bid for the 2022 World Cup.<nl>In December 2014 FIFA had conducted their own investigation into the allegations of corruption however they did not release the findings of this investigation but just an executive summary. In which they claimed to have exonerated the bidding process of corruption. This decision shows that in 2014 they were not willing to make any major changes or take responsibility for the corruption and bribery that took place. These actions could show FIFAs unwillingness to change these practices and shows in the future it will still be standard practice for FIFA to take bribes.<nl><nl>2022 World Cup:<nl>There are many arguments surrounding the FIFA scandal some people argue that Qatar should not be allowed to host the 2022 World Cup as it effectively rewards their actions and involvement in the corruption. There are arguments that it would be inappropriate to allow a controversial state to host the World Cup and have such a large platform. The fact that this corruption harms so many people it breaches the ethics of virtues.  There are already red flags being raised about the 2022 World Cup and the fact that for the first time in its history it will be held in the winter due to the temperatures in the summer in the middle east. Anti-corruption expert Sylvia Schenk believes that if there was a legal dispute regarding this it would not be resolved until at least 2028 at which point it is ineffective. <nl>Between the scandal in 2015 and the World Cup that is due to take place in 2022 there have been many years and many different chances for FIFA officials to set a precedent and show that they are committed to stamping the corruption out of FIFA. One way to achieve this would be to allow another country to host the 2022 World Cup. It has been argued that this would not be too difficult as many countries have the infrastructure e.g., stadiums set up to accommodate the World Cup therefore logistics should not be an issue here. This shows that FIFA do not appear to have taken anything away from the scandal and try and change for the better.<nl><nl>Human Rights:<nl>The issues regarding the 2015 scandal are still Widely debated 2021. With Qualifying stages of the 2022 World Cup starting players have been protesting the allegations of human rights of migrant workers being breached in Qatar due to host the 2022 World Cup. The Guardian revealed in February 2021 that since Qatar won the bid to host the tournament in 2010 over 6,500 migrant workers have died in Qatar. However, this shocking statistic could be misleading it is impossible to know how many of these deaths are related to human rights breaches and how many are related to the World Cup. This however does not look good for FIFA or Qatar surrounding this global event especially as 37 deaths have been directly linked to the construction of the stadiums. This issue that is gaining global traction due partly to Norway who on the 24th of March protested by wearing T-shirts during the warmup which read \"human rights on and off the pitch \"in their World Cup qualifying match. Other teams have started to follow suit by wearing T-shirts raising awareness of the problem. Kimmich has argued that teams are 10 years too late to boycott. The damage has already been done and Qatar have been allowed to get away with this for far too long protests should have been taking place when Qatar was allocated the World Cup and before they started building all the stadiums. However, The German football Federation is not in favour of boycotting the World Cup. So, all the T-shirt wearing in the world will not help the migrant workers that have died or will continue to die for this World Cup or others to come. This is yet another example of a time where FIFA have sat back and let corruption run rife within its organisation six years after the corruption scandal this therefore shows they have not made major improvements or changes to stop his from happening for many more years to come.<nl><nl>Social Responsibility:<nl>It is not just a legal field that believes FIFA are problematic. It is argued that FIFA are also corrupt in terms of their corporate social responsibility. In a 2014 study it was found that corporations and companies that sponsored FIFA were disliked more and trusted less by the public and people are more likely to negatively talk about these brands with their peers. This study can be very negative for FIFA and the many brands that pay them millions in sponsorship. This could cause massive problems for FIFA in the future if corporations and brands the sponsor that events decide that they do not want to be associated any more. This is one example of how the corruption scandal has negatively impacted FIFA is brand and therefore value. Therefore, correcting and changing this public perception will be crucial to FIFAs continued success. <nl><nl>Feminist Perspective:<nl>There is also a view that FIFA is a \"boys club\". Professional tennis player Billie Jean King has tried to advocate for FIFA to hire more female managers and to appoint more females into higher roles within the company and hire someone specifically for the purpose of regulating gender equality within the company. She also raises a point that having more women within FIFA could improve the culture of corruption that exists. There have been studies that show that women are less likely to be involved in bribery and are less likely to condone bribe taking.  Data from different countries shows that corruption is less severe where women held more seats in parliament or more senior positions and comprise of a larger share of the labour force. Therefore, viewing this issue from the feminist perspective one way FIFA could counter some corruption could be to employ women in more positions and in more senior roles. However, it could be argued that this is less of a gender difference and more of a culturally based issue in however due to the global nature of FIFA this could potentially make a difference. The fact that some of these issues were raised years ago and have not been acted upon shows once again that FIFA are not dedicated to eradicating corruption.    <nl><nl>Legalities:  <nl>FIFA is registered and incorporated under swiss law. It is a very attractive base for many international organisations not only due to its location and political stability Switzerland also has most importantly a very lenient legal code and attractive tax regime. This could be one of the reasons that attracted FIFA to incorporate itself there. Switzerland is perceived to be a country that is least affected by corruption however this does not prevent organisations that are located there being involved in corruption. Article 332 of the Swiss criminal code only refers to the bribery of a public official as criminal therefore there is no criminal liability for the bribery of officials in international sports organisations such as FIFA. It could be argued that this is one of the reasons that corruption and bribery has run rampant within FIFA for so many years. It could be argued that under the Swiss federal act on unfair competition the type of bribery happening within FIFA could be criminally prosecuted. However transparency International believe that it is unclear whether this would be applicable to sport and FIFA. In 2004 the Federal Council ruled that this article did not apply to non-governmental organisations e.g. FIFA. There have been moves made by the Swiss Parliament to change the law so that Bribery that does not involve public officials can be criminally charged. This was following a recommendation from GRECO. This accountability should prevent more bribes taking place within FIFA.<nl><nl>Geography:<nl>The sheer scale and vast geography that FIFA covers could be one of the main enablers in the corruption and bribery that takes place. Although FIFA is covered by Swiss law the majority of the crimes did not take place in Switzerland this creates a situation where it is impossible for one country to be able to keep track and punish such a large organisation. FIFA is a billion-pound empire that effectively has the ability to punish countries this makes them untouchable. This system negatively affects smaller and poorer countries. Morocco was also competing for the 2022 World Cup and after spending millions on the campaign they lost out to Qatar due to the bribes Qatar paid to FIFA officials.  Currently 32 teams and subsequently 32 countries play in the World Cup, FIFA have been discussing pushing this to 48 countries. Bringing more countries in to the World Cup could potentially reduce corruption and bribery as that is more accountability and even more countries will be watching them. However, this could go the other way and now there are 16 more countries that could be involved in bribery. When Qatar was awarded the 2022 World Cup they denied Morocco the chance to host the World Cup. It could be argued that Morocco deserve the World Cup more as they are a smaller economy and the World Cup would have benefited them more than Qatar. It could also be argued that after the  bribery Qatar used to gain the world cup came to light Morocco should have been awarded the World Cup. There has been talks of Spain Portugal and Morocco  teaming up for a joint bid for the 2030 World Cup however Spain and Portugal signed a joint bid agreement and left Morocco out once again this could be devastating for Morocco’s economy. There have been studies into GDP and corruption. Qatar’s GDP is 175.8 billion c compared to Morocco’s 119.7 both in 2019. The study indicates that the poorer country the more likely they are to be susceptible to corruption however in this example that does not seem to be the case as based on GDP Qatar has more wealth but clearly, they were more susceptible to bribery.  <nl><nl>Psychology:<nl>There are many Psychological theories and there has been lots of research completed in regards to bribery and corruption. One of the main theories that comes from psychological studies is the trust game. This was first created by Berg et al the results from the study were surprising and went against the standard economic theory upon which they were based. The theory and results of this study can be applied to FIFA the anonymity and scale of the bribery makes it easier for people to be corrupted as there is a level of anonymity. One problem with this theory is that the study was done in 1995 on a very small population therefore the results cannot be generalised to modern society and the global society where customs cultures and values vary massively. Studies like this one tend to be studied by white men and study white men therefore there is massive gender and racial bias involved in the results of this study which reduce the effectiveness of it outside of the context of a single study.  Similar studies were conducted that compared data from many different countries to see if there was a relationship between nationality and the likelihood to take or condone bribery.  The study found that collectivism versus individualism on a national scale was the fact and most likely to affect bribery. This theory seems to line up with Qatar as it has a very large wealth divide. This divide makes it much easier for people to take part in bribes. In 1995 there was a cross national study focusing on ethics this study found that there was substantial crossover between personality values but the moral reasoning very significantly. The psychologists use social cognitive theory to explain the practical implications of this study. This could explain why some countries are more likely to be involved in bribery than others due to social cognitive theory and shared values of a society. There are many different areas of psychology that relate directly to bribery and corruption and the FIFA scandal. These theories should be able to show a way for bribery to be reduced in the future. This can be seen using the evolutionary psychology principle. This theory states that there are distinct patterns of corruption that can be seen throughout history with the FIFA 2015 corruption scandal named as one. This theory explains that social and cultural norms have evolved over time to allow to happen more freely. This could be good news for FIFA as it could explain why so much bribery has happened within the organisation and it could help reduce their blame and liability for the bribery. This theory can also show how to reduce bribery within FIFA in the future.          <nl><nl>Legal Case:<nl>The sheer scale and vast geography that FIFA covers could be one of the main enablers in the corruption and bribery that takes place. Although FIFA is covered by Swiss law the majority of the crimes did not take place in Switzerland this creates and in capability of anyone to be able to keep try and punish such a large organisation. FIFA is billion-pound empire that effectively has the ability to punish countries this makes them untouchable. This system negatively affects smaller and poorer countries. Morocco was also competing for the 2022 World Cup and after spending millions on the campaign they lost out to Qatar due to the bribes Qatar paid to FIFA officials.

Bringing more countries in to the World Cup could potentially reduce corruption and bribery as that is more accountability and even more countries will be watching them. However, this could go the other way and now there are 16 more countries that could be involved in bribery. When Qatar was awarded the 2022 World Cup they Denied Moscow the chance to host the World Cup. It could be argued that Morocco deserve the World Cup more as they are a smaller economy and the World Cup would have benefited them more than guitar. It could also be argued that after the truck in time like Morocco should have been awarded the World Cup. There has been talks of Spain Portugal and Morocco  teaming up for a joint bid for the 2030 World Cup however Spain and Portugal signed a joint bid agreement and left Morocco out once again this could be devastating for Morocco’s economy. There have been studies into GDP and corruption. Catarrhs GDP is 175.8 billion c compared to Morocco’s 119.7 both in 2019. The study indicates that the poorer country the more likely they are to be susceptible to corruption however in this example that does not seem to be the case as base of GDP Qatar has more wealth but clearly, they were more susceptible to bribery.  <nl>To conclude it appears that FIFA have not done everything in their power to prevent further corruption happening since the 2015 scandal. However, it is a very large and complex issue that covers many legal and political jurisdictions. This therefore makes it very hard to give definitive answer to how well FIFA dealt with the scandal. From my research for this essay, I have come across many recommendations for how FIFA could reduce bribery and corruption from so many different academic disciplines and the fact that FIFA has not implemented any of the shows FIFA has not learnt from 2015. On balance it appears they have not made enough changes to prevent this from happening again.", "<addr1_FN>,<nl><nl>Please can you help me.

{"id": "20ac8703-6133-4670-9713-92117b5bf825", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Rationale:<nl>Evolving social norms are a prominent feature of our current century. More than ever those who defy the gender binary and expectations of their sex are prominent in our society. An annual month-long celebration of LGBT history is held every February in the UK with gay and civil rights movements a focal educational point. However, suicide rates are higher in those who identify as transgender or gender nonconforming compared to the overall population, (Goldblum, Testa, Pflum, Hendricks, Bradford &amp; Bongar 2016) and sexual minority college students report experiencing a range of interpersonal heterosexism (Hong, Woodfood, Long, &amp; Renn, 2016). This analysis aims to illustrate what is understood regarding the possible discourses of young adults surrounding the LGBT communities, with the main emphasis on heteronormativity and gender binaries. The analysis consisted of a semi-structured interview with an undergraduate student, based on the research question, \"How do undergraduate students talk about heteronormativity and gender binaries?\". Attached below is the interview schedule which details what is understood regarding heteronormativity and gender binary through overarching societal (media, education), economical, and political (health and political parties) themes of the questions. Discourse analysis was deemed an appropriate analysis to gain a deeper understanding regarding gender binary and heteronormativity amongst young adults, and the ways in which these topics are viewed and expressed. Research has demonstrated how discourse analysis is suitable for a range of topics in order to assess the language as practice, hence why it is appropriate for this topic (Wodak and Meyer (2009). For the purpose of confidentiality, the interviewee will be referred to by the pseudonym Katy in this analysis.<nl>Results <nl>Discourse 1: ‘Expectations and Norms’<nl>Katy recognises and highlights the societal expectation and norms that are adhered to gender and the relationship it has with being heteronormative. Katy raises these points through the discursive object of gender and the discourse of societal expectations and norms. She illustrates that the gender binary belief is ‘that there are just two genders…directly linked to sex’ and acknowledges that the endorsement of heteronormative attitudes in childhood such as young cisgender females to ‘like the colour pink’ and young cisgender males to play with ‘plastic guns’. Through the technique of listing, for example ‘a little girl should like girly things, like the colour pink, want to have baby dolls’, Katy demonstrates an inclusive awareness of what is expected of the female gender as a young child, which should mould her into ‘a housewife’, as Katy depicts such toys are ‘kind of training them to be a mother’ which illustrates the future expectations of women guided by heteronormativity. <nl><data_excerpt><nl>Katy provides an anecdotal portrayal of sexual health education which depicts the societal maintenance of heteronormativity further illustrating the discourse of societal expectations and norms. She recalls learning how to use a condom but concludes ‘I didn’t find it that useful’ suggesting the school curriculum is not inclusive of LGBTQ+ relations and through disregarding non-heterosexual sexual health perpetuates a heteronormative society. <nl><data_excerpt><nl>Discourse 2: ‘Tools of Awareness’<nl>The discursive object of ‘awareness’ becomes prevalent when Katy depicts some of the issues facing individuals who do not conform to gender norms. Katy uncovers a love-hate relationship with the media. She attacks it’s lack of diversity and slow progression; ‘if you look at stuff even from a couple years ago, like how a lot of tv programs have, are just so (1) are so heteronormative’  but credits its role in bringing awareness to sexual minority groups; ‘even that small introduction of a gay couple, or a trans person(.) like even a brief glimpse of it on tv or on and advert is quite revealing’ illustrating the power the media has; it can be used as a tool of oppression or acceptance dependant on the source.<nl><data_excerpt><nl>Awareness is further explored in regard to the appropriate proxemics to which orientation should be discussed. Katy establishes the boundaries in which she believes orientation is suitable to be considered. In terms of job applications, she suggests ‘it depends on the role’ when discussing an applicant’s gender, contradicting what was previously discussed regarding gender binary i.e. it raises the question what roles are gender dependant. However, she declares sexual orientation is ‘just not necessary’ for such applications, deeming the process ‘very intrusive’. Through the lexical choice of ‘intrusive’, Katy implies that such questions are invasive of an individual’s privacy, and reflects back on the issues of heteronormativity \"You wouldn’t ask a straight person those kind of questions, instead of being aware I think it has the potential to create a target on that person so no I don’t think an employer needs to know anyone’s sexuality’<nl><data_excerpt><nl>Discourse 3: ‘Economics and Expenses’<nl>Expenses associated regarding the LGBTQ+ community is a dominant discourse when discussing the associated politics. Katy expresses an awareness of political dichotomy in terms of financial support for these communities. Katy exclaims \"they don’t put enough funding into like, uhm(.) well anything LGBT!\". Through the use of hyperbole in this discussion Katy emphasises her belief that the right-wing parties are unsupportive. This is further emphasised through the comparison drawn between the political spectrum, \"I think there’s more sympathy uhm and there’s more diversity within the left wing\". Katy develops a narrative which <nl><data_excerpt><nl>The discursive object of ‘expenses’ evolves from the financial costs to the emotional ones. The discourse expands to the emotional costs of ‘coming out’, ‘transitioning’ and ‘mental wellbeing’ (lines 178-180), the triad of emotional costs Katy presents provide an insight to the volume of pressure individuals who defy the strict gender binary are subjected to and how perpetuating a heteronormative image is mentally damaging.<nl><data_excerpt><nl>Katy sympathises with the ‘hardship’ individuals who wish to transition must endure. She raises the issues of emotional expenses and relates it back to the financial costs regarding funding; ‘more funding in place, more support in place…especially [for] young people’. Thereby illustrating the impact of politics on sex and gender and the influence of society. <nl><nl>Discussion<nl>The discourse throughout the interview has a lot of empathy undertones towards the issues faced by various LGBTQ communities e.g. gender non-conforming individuals and examines some root issues of such discriminations, for example the societal maintenance of heteronormativity through school teachings. Katy engages with the discourse through the various political, social, economic and cultural questions asked, and responds with awareness of the challenges they are faced and positions herself to be against the discriminations and shows compassion for the individuals who have been subjected to it. As a cisgender female, Katy can empathise with the issues surrounding gender binary; she understands how it feels to be tied to your biological sex and has expressed an awareness of how the relationship between sex and gender can be complicated however Katy can only sympathise for those who have transitioned or are gender non-conforming, this becomes apparent when comparing the volume to which Katy speaks about heteronormativity in comparison to gender binary. This research was conducted with one individual’s perspective; it may not be representative of all young adults opinions of gender binary and heteronormativity therefore cannot be generalised.", "<addr8_FN>,<nl><nl>I hope you are well.<nl><nl>I just wanted to send a quick follow up email regarding something you said in the webinar a couple of weeks back.

{"id": "fd6a9d9d-c1e4-45cf-8507-4d985c46cc12", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Pregnancy loss is often silenced and shamed whether it’s miscarriages, termination for medical reasons or stillborn deaths (Keane, 2009). This essay will focus specifically on miscarriages in the first trimester because of the stigma surrounding the validation of mourning a ‘human that didn’t exist’. This essay will also explore the discussions around motherhood, why women feel they are labelled ‘failed mothers’, and recommendations to reduce the stigma around early miscarriages.<nl>Motherhood has been the central and imperative role in a woman’s life. In a woman’s lifetime, she is expected to reproduce in order to fulfil the responsibility of ‘bearers of the collective’. The importance of being the ‘bearers of the collective’ ensures that reproduction allows society to function, and never ‘die out’. Because of this duty, these expectations have shaped women’s identities to believe all women will become mothers. Early miscarriages go against the concept of motherhood, and for this reason, there is stigmatisation around miscarriages. Stigma is defined as an ‘attribute that is deeply discrediting’ (Goffman, 1963:3), hence the shame and silence around miscarriages. Because of this stigma and duty placed on women, miscarriages deem women to be ‘failed mothers’.<nl>Many women believe they’ll have a successful pregnancy and start to prepare for the new addition. However, not all pregnancies are successful. In fact, ‘first trimester miscarriages are by far the most frequent type of pregnancy loss’ (Layne, 2000:325). When a miscarriage occurs, no one is to blame, however, the blame tends to fall on the woman (Abboud &amp; Liamputtong, 2002). Blame-shifting is a central factor of the stigmatisation around early miscarriages. The blame goes to the extent of the woman also accepting the blame, and believing she was the cause of the miscarriage (Miller, 2015). Moreover, the blame reinforces her inabilities as she renders herself incapable and questions whether something is wrong with her (Miller, 2015; Gerber-Epstein, et al., 2008). A study conducted by Abboud &amp; Liamputtong (2002) found that participants were blamed for their activities which allegedly caused their miscarriage. For example, a participant stated, \"They blame me that it’s my fault, that when I was pregnant, I was dancing, that I wasn’t eating properly. It’s my fault that this happened\" (2002:47). However, according to Sandford Health, it’s essential to exercise to combat the fatigue and hormonal changes during the first trimester (Seitz, 2019). Furthermore, the search for reasoning in early miscarriages causes blame-shifting on the woman, in which she accepts she has failed her duty to be the bearer of the collective, and essentially she is seen as a failed mother.<nl>As aforementioned, the blame allows the woman to accept the moral responsibility of the demise, but realistically she has failed an expectation which is uprooted in intensive motherhood. Intensive motherhood is the philosophy of maximising the potential of a person to become a better version of themselves. In this case, women have adapted to this belief through the understanding of gender roles. Gender roles have set in stone that women are to be housewives and mothers, and from a young age, girls are taught how to cook and nurture. A participant stated that \"the illusion is created not during the pregnancy, but when we are small girls, when we’re still playing with dolls, we already think about being mothers, about children, because it’s in our nature\" (Gerber-Epstein, et al., 2008:16). The bonding with dolls maximises the potential for young girls to become mothers in the future. In addition, the act of bonding is extended in pregnancy which develops attachment between the woman and the foetus. However, miscarriages interrupt the bonding process that women have adopted since they were young, leaving them confused and empty. The impact of intensive motherhood allows women to develop the ‘picture-perfect’ family idea and believe having children fulfils their purpose of being a woman. In essence, the woman’s identity is defined by her ability to conceive. <nl>The intensive motherhood belief also implies that women have to become mothers, and this contributes to the reason why women try again after a miscarriage to maintain the responsibility of the bearer of the collective. A husband of a participant in the Abboud &amp; Liamputtong study said that \"she kept trying…she insisted…she wanted a boy, like all the other women\" and this was due to his wife feeling she needed a baby to please her husband (2002:54). This implies that miscarriages make women feel they’re inadequate wivespartners, as well as inadequate women, and in order to change that, they must conceive. This also echoes the discussion that motherhood validates a woman’s place in society. Becoming a mother makes a woman an accepted person in society and even in her family home. All in all, intensive motherhood prepares women for the position they play in society – which is to become mothers. Until they do so, they’re ‘failed mothers’ or ‘deviant women’. <nl>Intensive motherhood works symbiotically with the policing of women’s bodies and behaviours. The first trimester of pregnancies is labelled as the ‘risky period’ (first 12 weeks) because this is when early miscarriages occur. For this reason, women are told to not get ‘too excited’ until the first trimester has passed. This period controls the woman’s experience of pregnancy due to biomedical framings. Rothman quoted in Ross (2015) states that ‘demands are placed on women to emotionally distance themselves from the pregnancy, and suspend experiences of attachment to the foetus until ‘it is deemed worth keeping’. For first time pregnancies, holding in excitement is almost impossible, therefore this biomedical framing creates a sense of uncertainty. Shildrick quoted in Ross (2015) argues that women’s bodies have been labelled as inferior. This implies that medical input has superiority over the woman’s body and makes it their obligation to know what’s right for her. Due to the ‘risky period’, women tend to keep the news to themselves and remain quiet about their pregnancy. Additionally, because of stigmatisation around early miscarriages, women refrain from announcing the news of their pregnancy to avoid announcing that they miscarried, and this is to avoid felt stigma and the actual stigma itself. Furthermore, women felt that society’s conventions around hiding a pregnancy until after the first trimester meant they felt alone and isolated in their feelings (Bellhouse, et al., 2018:7). Overall, the biomedical framings have created a scare around the first trimester in order to avoid the stigmatisation of being labelled a failed mother.<nl>Policing of women’s behaviours and bodies has become a routinized process, and women themselves believe every medical input is necessary during the pregnancy. During pregnancy, women are told what to eat and drink, especially at antenatal appointments. Undoubtedly, antenatal appointments have the intention of ensuring the health of the woman and the baby is prioritised, but there are elements of policing and monitoring her behaviours. For a first time pregnancy, up to 10 antenatal appointments are expected, and 7 for those who have had a child already (NHS, 2020), and these appointments ‘feature detailed discussions of women’s behaviours and encouragement to modify those seen as posing a risk to the pregnancy’ (Ross, 2015:330). These modifications allow women to think that if she doesn’t follow these rules, she is the cause of the miscarriage. In fact, most women follow the instructions of pregnancy, yet many still suffer miscarriages in the first trimester. These instructions imply that medical attention plays their part to also maximise the potential of a woman becoming a mother. Over time, women’s bodies have become the embodiment of distrust therefore medical attention during pregnancy is a core contribution to the transition from womanhood to motherhood, to avoid having a miscarriage. In brevity, if these rules are followed, it’s believed there are slim chances of miscarriages, and if they aren’t followed, a woman causes her miscarriage and she is a failed mother.<nl>The ‘risky period’ (12 weeks of gestation) can pose implications that the foetus isn’t an actual human until birth, therefore mourning a miscarriage tends to be unrecognised. The validity of the foetus can be discussed through the concept of foetal personhood. Foetal personhood raises questions in the validation of a woman’s loss as some would regard the foetus as ‘medical waste’. Martel’s study (2014) found that in Canada, pregnancies ending under 20 weeks gestation andor under the birth weight of 500 grams are not registered with Statistics Canada or issued a birth or death certificate. This indicates that foetuses shouldn’t be honoured like newborn babies, due to the fact that ‘miscarriage is not socially recognised in the same way that the loss of a born baby or family member might be’ (Bellhouse, et al., 2018:2).<nl>Medical technologies, such as ultrasounds and sonograms encourage the foetus to be seen as ‘real’, from a foetus to a baby. These technologies allow women to become attached to the foetus, and when the miscarriage occurs, the woman feels a great loss due to the bonding formed in the first trimester, and accept that the pregnancy loss is also real. In reality, some women don’t know they’re pregnant until they take pregnancy tests. They can assume the miscarriage is a delayed period, but the role of medical technologies encourages women to think of their ‘wished-for child as a person’ (Layne quoted in Keane 2009). Similarly, the assumption of the mother role is strengthened by hospital visits and medical technologies because the woman assumes she is a mother. The definition of a mother is \"a woman in relation to a child or children to whom she has given birth to\" (Oxford English Dictionary, 2002), and in the case of early miscarriages, this raises questions as to whether the woman who miscarried can mourn as if she were a mother. Nevertheless, whether the woman should be seen as a mother or not, the imagining of the child-to-be should validate her reasoning to feel the loss. The ‘construction of the ‘child’ is created by social actors (the parents) whose identities are shaped by being in a family relationship with them, and without this construction, the ‘child’ cannot exist’ (Mullin, 2015:32). Moreover, Mullin (2015) argues that although the foetus didn’t reach its full potential, it had the potential to do so, therefore the loss of a miscarried foetus should be recognised. Undeniably, the part medical technologies play in foetal personhood reinforces early miscarriages as a failure. The dismissal of recognition for miscarried foetuses further embodies that women who miscarry are failed mothers, as their miscarried foetus isn’t commemorated and is seen as ‘medical waste’.<nl>As previously mentioned, early miscarriages are regarded as medical waste, which invalidates the woman’s grief. The woman’s emotions during and after the miscarriage can be strengthened by her friends, family and medical staff by showing a lack of support, which further emphasises the woman labelled as a failed mother. Bellhouse’s study (2018) found that previous research shows that women affected by miscarriages feel a lack of recognition of their loss, as well as emotional support from those close to them. It is understandable that the woman’s support bubble may not understand her loss, but the emotional distance makes the woman feel alone. Some people around the woman encourage her to ‘get over it’ and forget about it, and urge her to try again. In Gerber-Epstein’s study (2008), a woman’s family had the tendency to insist her to return back to normality and try again. Another woman in the study recalled a doctor saying \"…you’ve got nothing to worry about, you’ll have a bleed in a few days.\" (2008:11). In Abboud &amp; Liamputtong’s study (2002), a woman’s husband said \"…the doctor said a couple of weeks and back to normal life and you can have a baby next month\" (2002:47). The lack of recognition of the woman’s grief and healing is prevalent around early miscarriages, which downplays her mourning. These quotes also reveal that women have to constantly work on fulfilling the responsibility of the bearers of the collective, despite what may be going on around them.<nl>Women who have suffered early miscarriages feel shame and embarrassment from their social circle. Some go as far as making insensitive comments and finding the silver lining in the miscarriage. In Bellhouse’s study, they found that \"approximately half of the women expressed feeling that others often did not understand their experience and therefore struggled to empathise with them and support them at the time of their miscarriage, leading to feelings of hurt and disappointment\"(2018:5). People said to a participant in Bellhouse’s study \"oh you know, you’ll get pregnant again’, or, um, ‘oh it was meant to be\" (2018:6). Apart from the insensitive comments, people found ways to blame women for their life choices and activities (e.g. working too hard) as a reason for the miscarriage (Bellhouse, et al., 2018). The shame and embarrassment also extend to women over the age of 30 that miscarry. Although there is no set age for childbearing, it is believed that childbearing rates start to fall low in women over the age of 30 (Noord-Zaadstra, et al., 1991). In Abboud &amp; Liamputtong’s study, a participant’s husband stated \"…she was crazy to get pregnant again. In her mind she was too old, and it’s very hard to get pregnant again with her age and menopause\" (2002:53). The woman in the study was between the ages of 37-38, yet she felt she had to prove to her husband her capability to become a mother. Furthermore, this reveals older women experience the stigma of being a failed mother, seeing as they’re nearing the age of menopause. The lack of support from family and friends of the woman suffering from the miscarriage strengthens her label as a ‘failed mother’ as many fail to legitimise her feelings, instead they urge her to try again, rather than allowing her to grieve and heal.<nl>The aftermath of early miscarriages makes women experience feelings such as helplessness, sadness, guilt, irritability, repeated recollection of the experience and fear (Walker &amp; Davidson quoted in Gerber-Epstein, et al., 2008). Many women who experience an early miscarriage feel they’re worthless, disabled, and inadequate (Gerber-Epstein, et al., 2008; Ross, 2015). During this period, women can become envious of other women with children because it reminds them that they’re failed mothers (Gerber-Epstein, et al., 2008). Moreover, women feel they have disappointed themselves and everyone around them. Some women go as far as opting for tubal ligation and adoption seeing as they’re unable to conceive. A woman revealed she and her partner were planning tubal ligation to prevent future pregnancies as she had suffered seven miscarriages (Abboud &amp; Liamputtong, 2002). Similarly, another woman said \"I was already thinking I ought to adopt a child, because I already said I wouldn’t be able to have children\" (Gerber-Epstein, et al., 2008:15). These women have accepted that they are failed mothers due to the frequency of miscarriages, and settle for alternatives. Women who have experienced early miscarriages often feel scared to get pregnant again, because they feel that their future pregnancies will result in early miscarriages. Overall, these feelings remind women of what they’re not – which is a mother. Early miscarriages also remind them that they have defied the transition from womanhood to motherhood, and they have failed the duty of the bearers of the collective.  <nl>These feelings tend to go unnoticed and untreated by the woman’s support bubble and medical staff, and if left ignored, it can haunt the woman for a long time (Frost, et al., 2007). It’s important that women who have suffered early miscarriages feel they’re not failed mothers, neither are they alone. In regards to family and friends, it’s important for them to speak about the miscarriage so the woman isn’t the only one acknowledging the loss. A woman and her husband found that speaking about the miscarriage helped her grieving process (Abboud &amp; Liamputtong, 2002), and women who spoke to other women who had miscarried felt it helped them (Bellhouse, et al., 2018). It’s also vital that the woman’s family and friends are willing to listen to her, and allow her to mourn at her own pace (Bellhouse, et al., 2018; Gerber-Epstein, et al., 2008). Creating memories are just as important because it acknowledges the loss, rather than forgetting the miscarriage. A couple found it helpful to take their miscarried babies to their house to create memories and reminders (Abboud &amp; Liamputtong, 2002). Other women found comfort in commemorating their miscarriage through pregnancy loss websites where the miscarried children are represented in the form of angels (Keane, 2009).<nl>Medical care needs to devote time for counselling and support for women after miscarriages to help them process the miscarriage, as well as being sensitive and reassuring (Abboud &amp; Liamputtong, 2002; Gerber-Epstein, et al., 2008). Women also feel medical care should provide more information and knowledge on miscarriages so women understand how common it is (Frost, et al., 2007; Bellhouse, et al., 2018). In addition, society needs to acknowledge the loss so women don’t feel stigmatised. Suggestions such as public speeches, talks, and medical conferences can lessen the silence around early miscarriages (Frost, et al., 2007). Most importantly, it’s important to stop the blame-shifting onto women who miscarry (Frost, et al., 2007), and to stop the tradition of secrecy during the first trimester of pregnancy (the ‘risky period’). These recommendations will help women know they’re not failed mothers. Educating society and women’s support bubbles will improve the healing process for women.<nl>In conclusion, society’s expectations for women as bearers of the collective has allowed women to believe they’re failed mothers when they miscarry. The culture of blame-shifting contributes to women feeling invalidated until they become mothers. The lack of emotional and physical support following an early miscarriage emphasises the silence and stigmatisation around it. In order to overcome this, more information needs to be provided to society and women affected, to reassure them that they are not failed mothers.", " <addr10_FN>,<nl><nl>Once again thank you so much for your help last week.

Secondly, a cafÃ© I have recommended is the Fazer Cafe Kluuvikata 3. They will be capable of sitting inside and outside and is not far from the water as well. It is a little pricey but the reviews haves suggested that it is great, especially with the timing from 8am to 7pm, the CEO will be able to attend the cafÃ© from morning to evening. A museum to attend is the museum of contemporary art museum, which is located in the central of Helsinki. It costs $0-15, but with the small price to pay it is a beautiful setting to observe the art pieces on show. For a restaurant meal I have stated that the Restaurant Saaga as it serves the national dish called the PoronkÃ¤ristys. The reviews say that the place has great ambiance. It also serves a vegetarian option as well as an all you can eat buffet which really provides a lot of options. A gift shop which is fairly close is the Kanturin Tupa shop, it provides all the gifts necessary for her kids to take home, it is also relatively close. Finally, to end the trip a concert on the 4th of September to listen to the band featuring Lauri Tahka.

These firms have had a significant boost since 2002; also referred to as the ‘going global era.’ They tend to come from emerging, upper-middle income economies and developing countries and use a variety of entry modes such as joint ventures, strategic alliances and wholly owned subsidiaries (Guillen &amp; Garcia-Canal, 2009). However, the majority choose to expand rapidly into developed countries using M&amp;A’s and are late movers. A growing number of EMNE’s are starting to dominate certain industries such as banking, telecommunications and engineering and outward FDI from emerging countries is increasing. For example, China has increased its presence within the Fortune 500 between 2004 and 2019; whilst the presence of US firms has started to decrease, showing the ever-growing dominance of EMNE’s (Fortune Global 500, 2004,2019). There’s several firms many of us from the western world may not have realised are owned by EMNE’s, such as Tetley being owned by TATA – an Indian conglomerate; meaning it owns several different types of businesses and McVitie’s being owned by Turkish EMNE, Yildiz Holding.<nl>This essay will highlight the key differences between MNE’s and EMNE’s and examine how effective current theories are at explaining outward FDI from emerging country multinationals and compare and contrast them to the more recent theories which have been developed; including the LLL model and Springboard theory. Some academics believe these new EMNE’s have different motivations, which don’t necessarily fit in with the traditional theories; whilst others think that these theories can be applied just as effectively as the newer ones. <nl>Key differences between traditional western MNE’s and EMNE’s<nl>Only a decade ago many EMNE’s, which are booming today and challenging some of the most established MNE’s in many industries, were marginal competitors. So how have they managed to do this in such a short space of time and be successful? It’s important to look at the key characteristics of both traditional MNE’s and the newer EMNE’s to see what makes them so different. A main difference is the speed they internationalise. Many traditional MNE’s expand gradually, following the Uppsala model whereby they expand into countries which are psychologically close considering factors such as, geography, shared language and shared cultures. On the other hand, EMNE’s expand at a more accelerated pace. They do this to close the gap between their market reach and the global presence of MNE’s from developed countries (Mathews, 2006). A good example of an EMNE which has expanded rapidly is Chinese firm Huawei. In just five years, despite starting as a domestic firm in 2001, it was operating in over 100 countries by 2006. It did this by providing solid technology at low prices and hiring low cost engineers at 20% of western rates. This allowed them to strongly compete against western MNE’s and expand quickly (Fey et al, 2016). EMNE’s also use latecomer advantage whereby they learn from mistakes of MNE’s already established in the market and do better themselves. MNE’s are essentially used as ‘guinea pigs.’ With regards to ownership advantages many MNE’s have the required resources available to them internally; making this a big advantage if they were to expand into developing countries. However, EMNE’s are sometimes seen as having weak ownership advantages, but many believe this is debatable as their institutional advantages are so strong and they can also just obtain resources and capabilities through M&amp;A’s; which would naturally upgrade their ownership advantages. <nl>Institutional advantages are another key element to consider when comparing the firms. It’s well documented that traditional MNE’s have struggled significantly in countries with institutional voids as they’re used to political stability; due to coming from countries with highly stable environments. As a result, they don’t have the same experiences to cope with instability in the same way as EMNE’S. New EMNE’s are known to have this as a big advantage over traditional MNE’s, as they’re used to dealing and complying with discretionary and unstable governments in their domestic countries, therefore meaning they’re better prepared to succeed in foreign countries with weak institutional environments (Cuervo-Cazurra &amp; Genc, 2008). It’s also believed that if EMNE’s can successfully thrive in unstable developing countries, they most certainly can be successful in stable, developed countries. Finally, there’s key differences in the organisational adaptability of MNE’s versus EMNE’s. It’s believed that EMNE’s are much more adaptable than MNE’s which tend to suffer from inertia, by being stuck in their ways, as they have deeply ingrained values, cultures and organisational structures (Guillen &amp; Garcia-Canal, 2009). Consequently, they tend to have lower success rates with M&amp;A’s due to their lack of adaptability - almost two thirds of acquisitions by western firms end in failure, as the acquirer doesn’t give flexibility to the firm acquired. On the other hand, EMNE’s tend to have a high M&amp;A success rate - 67% success rate, as their adaptability is high, and they appreciate the firm they acquire more; due to their lack of global presence. <nl>Existing theories and their relevance<nl>Two major theories which explain the existing ways firms expand overseas successfully are Dunning’s Eclectic Paradigm and the Uppsala Model. Dunning uses OLI theory to explain why firms use outward FDI; suggesting the key advantages as being ownership advantages, location advantages and internalisation advantages. Ownership advantages refer to valuable resources and capabilities a firm offers a country it expands into, which gives them a competitive advantage. Many argue that due to their lack of capabilities and resources, coming from developing countries, EMNE’s can’t satisfy this part of the OLI paradigm. Going by Dunning’s explanation this would mean that they’re unable to engage in outward FDI, however many still do and are proven successful. Furthermore, some believe EMNE’s from developing countries could be considered to have ownership disadvantages, as they lack a well-known image and may not have the ability to compete on the same scale as western MNE’s, who have larger finances and advanced technologies (Fey et al, 2016). In addition, location advantages are required by Dunning to expand overseas effectively; this is what host countries can offer to a firm undertaking FDI there (Dunning, 1979). However, many EMNE’s don’t go abroad to access location advantages, such as lower cost production, lower labour costs or cheaper technology; as they already have this available to them in their domestic markets. For example, many Chinese firms won’t outsource their production to a developed country if they’re to expand their firm into them, because it’s well documented that production and labour within China can be done at a much cheaper cost to say that in the US.  As both ownership advantages and location advantages aren’t satisfied in the OLI paradigm, it makes it possible to say that the theory could become redundant or less relevant as more EMNE’S become successful in developed markets; without having satisfied all three elements within the paradigm. <nl>Secondly, the Uppsala model is another model used to explain the internationalisation of firms. It emphasises how firms go abroad incrementally and increase commitments gradually. This may mean they go into countries close to their domestic market first. A firm may first export to a country, then open an overseas subsidiary and finally build or acquire their own factory abroad as they gain more knowledge about the market and establish their operations. EMNE’S are unfortunately thought to leapfrog some steps outlined above and may even start the internationalisation process by becoming ‘born global’ and setting up the factory first. According to Eriksson et al (2000), the Uppsala Model is based on the idea that the behaviour of the internationalisation process is path dependent. Path dependence is a process based on the accumulated knowledge from the firm’s past international experience, which directs the firm’s future trajectory (Eriksson et al, 2000). A main concern is that Uppsala explains this path dependence but EMNE’s have no experience in developed countries to use. As a result, they can only use knowledge of developing countries. On the other hand, MNE’s know all about operating in developed markets so are at a bigger advantage. Finally, part of the Uppsala model is the idea of psychic distance - entering countries psychologically close. A main issue with this idea is that EMNE’s may not be able to use psychic distance to enter developed countries because they’re so different in nature. For example, developing countries may have stronger cultural, language, political and legal differences to developed countries. This would also be the case for MNE’s looking to expand into developing countries. <nl>The development of new theories<nl>As time has progressed new theories have been developed to try to explain and analyse how these new EMNE’s have used outward FDI to expand their presence internationally. The reason for creating these theories is because many couldn’t understand how these firms from countries with weaker country specific advantages could compete against the firms from developed countries. At first glance, it appears these EMNE’s have weaker firm specific advantages compared to their western rivals. <nl>The springboard theory was created (Luo and Tung, 2007) to explain why these firms expand so aggressively and the drivers behind this. The theory highlights seven elements. The first being that EMNE’s use their international expansion to compensate for their ownership disadvantages; this means that to counteract the fact they can’t offer a lot initially in terms of resources to the new market, they expand internationally and benefit from other means such as gaining resources from another firm through a M&amp;A. Immediately, this makes the OLI paradigm seem less relevant, as it’s highlighting that they can still be a success without initial ownership advantages. The second element of the theory says that EMNE’s use the international expansion to overcome their latecomer disadvantage; this means that they benefit from being able to see where MNE’s have made mistakes and ensuring they don’t make the same ones. Next, it explains that MNE’s from developing countries use international expansion as a springboard to counter-attack global rivals’ major foothold in their home country market. It also outlines that EMNE’s use outward FDI as a springboard to bypass certain trade barriers, such as quotas and anti-dumping penalties. This means that they go into another developingemerging markets with fewer restrictions. For example, if a Chinese firm were to set up a foreign subsidiary or production in Mexico and then export their good to the US. This again goes against the OLI paradigm as the firm isn’t directly using the location advantages of the US for production in the example above. Instead, they’re choosing to use those of Mexico to then sell in the US. Furthermore, the theory says new emerging MNE’s expand internationally to alleviate domestic institutional constraints. This for example could be if their home country doesn’t have strong patent laws, so they take their product elsewhere to be better protected therefore, benefitting from the county’s location advantage of having stronger patent protection. The final two elements explain that EMNE’s use international expansion to both secure preferential treatment offered by emerging governments and exploit their competitive advantage in other markets. To secure preferential treatment a domestic firm, say an Indian firm, may set up a subsidiary within the UK and then invest back into India to gain the tax benefit and the preferential government treatment. <nl>A second new theory developed is the LLL model (Mathews, 2006). This model has similarities to the Springboard theory in the way it explains why EMNE’s expand and internationalise. However, the key takeaway is that it says EMNE’s go abroad and then they learn. This is a massive contrast to the Uppsala model which emphasises the gradual process of expansion and firms using the knowledge they already possess to expand into markets with similarities, that are psychologically close. Firms going abroad and then learning highlights a more aggressive approach to expansion.  The three L’s in the model stand for linkage, leverage and learning. The linkage element examines the collaborations between EMNE’s and foreign firms through entry modes such as joint ventures, M&amp;A’s and alliances. Leverage explains that EMNE’s exploit global linkages to become ‘latecomers’ by harnessing resources and cost advantages to compete globally.  The second ‘L’ really highlights the idea that firms go abroad and then learn from the foreign partners already in the market and demonstrates why Dunning’s theory is less relevant of initially having certain ownership advantages to be successful. Finally, the learning element is the stage where EMNE’s acquire competitive advantages and learn how to compete internationally. Firms don’t need initial advantages necessarily; as they can expand and then learn and therefore become competitive. Overall, this model argues that firms acquire resources and learn over time before internationalisation occurs and the EMNE is integrated into the international activities. <nl>Although these theories have been developed and are more tailored to the new types of EMNE’s, they do still have their drawback such as underestimating the importance of absorption capacity and they go against the path dependence theory; as expressed in the Uppsala model. Finally, it’s clear that the importance of ownership advantages is dismissed; which is a key element in the existing OLI paradigm. <nl>In summary, it’s evident EMNE’s and traditional MNE’s differ both in the way they operate and the way they internationalise. Key differences include the speed EMNE’s internationalise compared with MNE’s and how differently they use or even don’t use their initial ownership advantages to ensure success abroad. Although they have their differences, both types of firm have proven to be successful in their own ways. However, there’s still a huge question mark over how these newer EMNE’s have prevailed so much globally. Thus, newer theories have been developed to try and explain this dominance. It must be said that although these new theories more accurately explain the rapid growth of EMNE’s and why having ownership advantages isn’t as essential as some older theories may suggest; they do still have their criticisms, as explained above. Consequently, further theories may have to be developed which are more accurate and less open to scrutiny. However, it really depends on individual views as to which theories are considered more relevant. Some would argue Dunning and the Uppsala model have been used for many years and can still be used effectively today, whilst others may say the world is constantly changing, as seen with the recent rise of EMNE’s, and therefore it’s necessary to keep developing and updating new theories. This will make them most effective and relevant to the current situations firms and countries find themselves in. For example, Carl Fey and others developed a new 5M framework which guides academics in their understanding of the internationalisation of EMNE’s (Fey et al, 2009). It proved that internationalisation is challenging for any firm. The largest challenge for EMNE’s, which is not always covered by the older theories, is overcoming the problem of a negative country image (Y.Y. Chang et al., 2009; E.Chang &amp; Taylor., 1999; Ferner et al., 2005; Smith &amp; Meiksins, 1995). It’s the job of newer theories to potentially provide insight into how EMNE’’s can overcome this challenge.", "Dear CEO, Please see below the details for your 2 day conference trip to Helsinki, Finland from 4th September to 6th for the duration of 2 nights stay.

{"id": "5dbf7c04-ddf9-4e2a-bdf9-2e66aa01c7e4", "discourse_types": ["essay", "text_message"], "pair": ["The introduction to this essay will explain doping as a form of corruption and will cite statistics to convey the extent of its effect on sport. This will be accompanied by an examination of what the spirit of sport is. This essay's critical debate aims to expose WADA's ineffectiveness in ensuring that the spirit of sport triumphs over the doping corruption. In this regard, WADA's loose grip on national and sport’s governing bodies can be seen to disrupt clean athletes. The debate then will shift to how WADA's code is fundamentally discriminatory against athletes from developing countries, causing less privileged athletes to face harsher realities for the committing the same offences as their contestants. These problems are exacerbated by corruption in different countries where the punishments handed down by authorities do not reflect the crimes. The eventual finding is that WADA is unsuccessful because it lacks necessary authority. This essay will also offer a critique of the proposal of legalised doping, shedding light on its shortcomings. It will be concluded that an increase in WADA’s power is required for the spirit of sport. The conclusion is that WADA will only be able to promote the spirit of sport effectively when they are the final arbiter in enforcing the code. This essay includes insights from Sports science, medicine, sociology, ethics, psychology and economics to support its claims.<nl>Corruption is defined as ‘dishonest or illegal behaviour, especially of people in authority’. Gorse and Chadwick suggest corruption in sport includes illegal, immoral or non-ethical activities, which intentionally seek to distort the outcome of a sports competition for one or more parties' personal benefit. , Gorse and Chadwick analysed 2,089 cases of corruption in sports, where doping was present in 95.64% of cases.<nl>The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) is responsible for leading a collaborative worldwide movement for doping-free sport. They stress that anti-doping programmes foster the ‘spirit of sport’ which includes values like ethics, joy, education, health and fair play. According to the World Anti-Doping Code (WADC), doping is contrary to the spirit of sport, so impressions of sporting achievement are important. When an athlete achieves success, it is helpful that their performances are not overshadowed by scepticism. The Sport of cycling can be used as an example.<nl>Reeth and Lagae surveyed if doping was acceptable among different demographics in the cycling community. They reported a clear view that doping contradicts the spirit of fair play. When Chris Froome became the first Briton to win the Tour de France twice, his second victory was marred by doping allegations. Froome was eventually proven innocent, but there is no doubt that the distrust created by Lance Armstrong made public scepticism inescapable for anyone that proceeded him. From a sociological point of view, this proves that the social significance of any sport is heavily reliant on its winning athletes. These winners are currently expected to work honestly for their accomplishments. This might be done by training hard simply with a special talent. However, the vital spirit of sport is undermined if the organisation which regulates anti-doping is unsuccessful in doing so.<nl>It is very possible that chalking Armstrong’s wins did nothing to solve the problems he created. When he became the first cycling colossus, he grew to establish a legacy that would see his accomplishments rise in importance as the sport's history evolves and more athletes fail to better him. That became a double-edged sword when anti-doping campaigns erased these victories, thus profoundly undermining the sport's past and underlying spirit. A relentless scepticism of innocent winners could also turn athletes away from the sport, fearing the scrutiny their lives would face if they had any success. Surely any failure to solve this issue could damage the spirit of a sport and this failure can be traced back to WADA?<nl><nl>Clean athletes often lose out<nl>The WADC exists to maintain a fundamental right to compete in doping-free competition. This is why, if the WADC fails, any athlete who competes clean suffers the consequences. It is often the case that those who win are recalled, occasionally with a thought for second and third place, while those who finish below the podium positions sometimes fade into obscurity. These individuals forfeit the life-changing status and wealth that comes with success because they miss out on awards to dishonest athletes who dope. It is therefore important WADA ensures ‘clean athletes don’t suffer the devastation of stolen medal moments’. <nl>Unfortunately, many athletes have already been affected by this calamity. The Associated Press estimated that $410,000 could be owed to thousands of athletes because of only four track and field players who never returned their prize money from the Olympic Games after being caught doping.  Athletes are also sometimes given a cash sum by their country for placing well in a sporting event. Moreover, those that do not make it to the podium are deprived of recognition; Jo Pavey, who finished fourth in the 10,000m at the 2007 World Championships, was still waiting for her bronze medal nearly a decade later. <nl>When it comes to fixing these injustices, WADA loses out just as much. Appeals to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) can currently be made to recover an athlete’s losses, but the views of CAS rarely align with WADA’s recommendations. On top of that CAS also risks having its own decisions set aside by the Swiss Federal Court. The current format then receives criticism because many of its legal efforts have focused disproportionately on the suspected athlete’s right to fair process, meaning they fail to provide clean athletes with the attention they deserve. On the other hand, there are reasons why suspected athletes deserve reasonable legal process, such as mitigating factors. Goalkeeper Andre Onana was recently suspended for mistakenly taking a painkiller that turned out to be a banned substance. Although it is the athletes' duty to ensure that no banned substance enters their bodies, ignoring defendants entirely in favour of clean athletes does not seem like the most reasonable alternative. <nl>That being said, allowing implicated athletes from Russia to compete in the 2016 Olympics, did nothing to convey any consequences of doping on a national scale. When the IOC refused to follow any of WADA's guidelines on Russia it showed a blatant disregard for the spirit of sport and for the right to compete in doping-free sport. Likewise, the decisions of CAS have been criticised for being inconsistent and still allowing corrupt athletes to participate. Despite CAS’ shortcomings, it is nevertheless the responsibility of the WADC to provide guidance on these matters, but rules for state endorsed doping did not exist at the time. Critics have argued that not addressing that issue was ‘… the most detrimental aspect of the Code’.<nl>One might then argue WADA's inability to protect all athletes who participate clean does not imply that they are the sole culprit, since this would set an impossibly high standard for WADA. However, when the authors of the universal anti-doping rule do not agree with the enforcers, it creates a divide between the different anti-doping authorities to the detriment of any clean athlete. More recently it was reported that WADA has opened a formal investigation into UK Anti-Doping for enabling British Cycling to conduct its own investigation into one of its riders. This supports the idea that WADA's lack of authority when imposing the spirit of sport is frequently amplified by the missteps of National and Sports Governing Bodies.<nl><nl>There is not a ‘level playing field’<nl>It may also be argued that the current anti-doping approach does not account for the differences caused by the various settings in which athletes live. This means there is not a fair playing field in sport. Firstly, it is not considered an unfair advantage to live in a wealthy country, yet athletes that do have a significant edge over their rivals from developing countries. Kayser and others argue that these conditions can sometimes come close to doping. <nl>Scholars from developing countries have argued that reaching a world class status in sports often reflects excellent equipment and facilities. Despite this, sport is not a top priority in any developing state. Research suggests that these countries instead rely on imported goods and sponsorships to provide amenities. The outcome is that athletes cannot become involved in ‘sophisticated doping’ in the same way as their competitors since they often lack the resources. Sports facilities in emergent countries are often not maintained because of their financial costs. Consequently, their usage is reduced which leads to a smaller number of local sports competitions. Further, UNESCO suggested in 2013 that there were considerable widespread shortfalls in the quality and quantity of facility and amenity provision, especially in low income countries. For that reason it would be absurd to conclude that talents from developing nations are ever really on a fair playing field, even from a young age. <nl>Corruption in developing countries such as Kenya only compounds these issues. WADA recognised that the doping practices of Kenyan athletes are ‘unsophisticated, opportunistic, and uncoordinated’. This is because testing techniques for older, well-known substances such as Erythropoietin (EPO) are well established meaning its users are easier to spot. The problem is that anti-doping tests are not equally as effective for athletes with access to newer substances. The comparatively unsophisticated doping practises of Kenyan athletes means they are typically caught, and therefore penalised, more often than their competition. This goes to show that a level playing field hardly ever exists.<nl>Operation Aderlass demonstrated these problems in action. In endurance sports, autologous blood doping (ABD), which allows athletes to supply more oxygen to their muscles, has been a big advantage for athletes until discovery., Only then did endurance athletes own up to doing it, probably because they felt that they would be singled out eventually. By contrast, some of Kenya’s highest profile athletes have been identified and banned from their sports because their doping practises were easier to identify. This demonstrates that not all cheaters are treated equally, not because some have committed more serious crimes than others, but because they are committing the same crime with less success.<nl>It may be argued that the nature of this imbalance seriously undermines whether anti-doping efforts are worthwhile and whether they help the spirit of sport. However, it is unfair to expect authorities to always be on top of doping. Still, WADA's anti-doping programmes aim to maintain sport's level playing field. When only certain athletes can use doping to their advantage, these ideals are damaged. As a result of this inequality, talented athletes from developed countries are forced to pursue other opportunities, and the sport suffers the consequences. Ultimately the disparity in doping practises also creates confusion around winners, making it difficult for people to trust whether achievements are the result of hard work or corruption. These are problems that WADA must resolve if it wants to restore confidence in the spirit of sport and offer better opportunities to athletes from developing countries who may risk being left behind if they compete clean.<nl><nl>WADA cannot enforce consequences<nl>'Operation Puerto' in Spain exemplified how WADA has frequently been obstructed in addressing its concerns. Multiple athletes were involved in this sandal. The Criminal Court of Madrid ruled that the evidence discovered by police should be destroyed, a verdict that WADA later challenged. Its former director general, David Howman, argued that ‘at times it seemed as if the intention was to delay any proper approach’. WADA were also unable to name the implicated athletes due to their own statute of limitations policy. <nl>The inability to reveal these facts proves that perceptions of achievement can sometimes be distorted to shield athletes at all costs. In the 2000s, Spanish athletes were worshiped as long as they continued to make Spain a sporting powerhouse (Soule and Kudovic 2011). Dr Fuentes confessed that his clients included athletes from many different sports. One might then argue that Spain and WADA still bear the same burden as in 2006: exposing the facts. A failure to do so not only casts doubt on those in power, but it also calls into question their ability to enforce the WADC. As a consequence, one might argue the values enshrined in the spirit of sport are abandoned at the price of one country.<nl>The implications of Operation Puerto still pale in comparison to those of Russia's state-led anti-doping regime. It involved the director of the anti-doping laboratory in Russia creating a mixture of banned substances that he gave to dozens of Russian athletes, enabling the most controversial doping scheme in history. While WADA endorsed a ban of 4 years, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) substituted a 2 year ban. It also repealed a WADA provision that would have forced Russian athletes to make clear that they were not involved with the scheme. The US anti-doping agency chief suggested the ruling was ‘a catastrophic blow to clean athletes, the integrity of sport, and the rule of law.’<nl>For many this has made it clear that WADA is a substandard organisation when it comes to enforcing its own code. In many countries, WADA must depend on the authorities' willingness to implement effective anti-doping policies and it is clear this scarcely happens. Furthermore, the implementation of the code is contingent governing bodies’ ability to punish the guilty parties for their violations of the code. Instead, these organisations often fall short of their responsibilities, raising doubts about their ability to enforce the code in light of the spirit of sport. This can only come back to bite WADA who are trapped in a vicious circle of making suggestions and not being listened to.<nl>Where it is vital that WADA intervenes it must rely on independent bodies, who have failed to be as unsparing as many would have hoped when bringing the Kremlin to book. Further to that, reinviting Russia's competitors to international competition under the guise of being ‘neutral athletes’ provides no evidence of any real repercussions for sport's most notorious doping scandal. What else could justify a ban on Russian athletes if a state-led doping programme cannot? As a direct result, sporting spirit often is forfeited in the blink of an eye, and it often appears that WADA's eyes are held shut due to their lack of authority. <nl><nl>Legalising doping is flawed<nl>It is only fair that critics of the current approach present alternative views about how doping can be better managed with the aim of promoting the spirit of sport. In that regard doping is difficult to regulate since most appropriate behaviours today can be considered as corrupt in the future. <nl>Some commentators recommend a supervised doping practise. There is a surplus of information on this subject which far exceeds the scope of this essay. The concept, though, can be narrowed down to a few key points: doping cannot be sufficiently safe as long as it is illegal, declaring that doping is unsafe becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy to some degree, since doping often occurs without adequate medical monitoring. They propose allowing medically controlled doping would provide a more solid basis for sports physicians to exercise their duty and fulfil their health-care obligations.<nl>While it is true that theories like principlism in medical ethics place high emphasis on autonomy and non-maleficence, and it is reasonable to believe that legalising doping could further these values, this essay argues that the dangers of controlled doping still outweigh the benefits. Indeed, these principles provide a method to define moral problems rather than provide answers. To begin with it is questionable whether more studies and funding on doping practises will lead to a lower risk to health. Despite decades of research live-saving drugs used to treat sepsis still carry high risks such as becoming deaf. As such, the proposal to minimise the risks associated with doping may be futile, since the current risks are already quite serious.<nl>It would also be difficult to define at what age someone can dope. The response is a proposal to prohibit competitive sports for children to avoid ethical dilemmas. This is obviously unrealistic, given that no nation will produce world class athletes unless young people participate in competitive sports. This moral dilemma is only complicated by athletes with pre-existing medical conditions. Sportspersons with polycystic kidney disease (PKD) have an inherited condition that causes numerous cysts in the kidneys. EPO, a common doping agent, is also produced in the kidneys. The problem is that EPO production is disrupted for these athletes, putting them at a disadvantage. Athletes with PKD would therefore suffer a great degree of inequality if EPO doping was legal. Anyone genetically predisposed to congenital heart condition (they are relatively common) could also be adversely affected by lots of performance enhancing drugs - by stressing the myocardium in such individuals they would be prone to potentially fatal arrhythmia. <nl>Therefore, it is argued that legalising a controlled doping practise would produce perhaps as much injustice as the current system. Sport can, however, proceed in several ways without facilitating the use of substances. The first sub-two-hour marathon ran by Eliud Kipchoge demonstrates how the use of mechanical help can produce new records. For cycling, athletes could use mechanically assisted bikes to help with hilly terrain. This is much safer than doping, however it is WADA that really needs to change.<nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>It has been argued that WADA’s actions have not contributed to the sporting spirit. WADA should have a much bigger say on the enforcement of the code, because its suggestions are often discarded by organisations for whom the spirt of sport is not always a significant objective. The proposal of controlled doping is not a suitable alternative. In the end, if the authors of the universal anti-doping rules are eventually made the ultimate arbiter, it will create an effective governing organisation with more power to actively ensure the spirit of sport.", "ll just as busy then?<new>I will do!

{"id": "aaa1f3ee-a336-4794-ad1e-0a519636383a", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Deductive and Inductive reasoning are examples of propositional logic to construct thoughts into a valid argument. Deductive reasoning begins from a general statement that leads to a certain conclusion (Johnson-Laird, 2000; Rips, 1999; Williams, 2000). For example, ‘all noble gases are stable, helium is a noble gas, so helium is stable.’  Inductive reasoning begins with specific observations which lead to a conclusion that is likely to explain the observation and the conclusion may be used to predict future specific occasions (Johnson-Laird, 2000). An example would be if all children in one day care like Legos, it could be assumed all children like Legos. <nl>A similarity between the reasonings are that they are both used to provide a valid argument and are used often. Another similarity is that both reasonings follow premises in which they base their argument on.<nl>A difference between inductive and deductive reasoning is that deductive reasoning begins with a hypothesis and tests the hypothesis via an observation whilst inductive reasoning begins with observations and then moves towards a theory. This is because deductive inference is based upon theory whilst inductive inference is based on observations. There is also a difference in validity between the reasonings as deductive reasoning is more precise as if all the premises are true then the conclusion is true for example, ‘if all dolphins are mammals and all mammals have kidneys, all dolphins therefore have kidneys.’ However, even if the premises are true in induction, the conclusion is still not definitely true. For example, ‘if the first button I get out of a bag is a red button, the third button I obtain from the bag is red, therefore it is inductive logic to conclude all the buttons in a bag are red.’ Therefore, deduction is more accurate and quantitative whilst induction is more general and qualitative. Due to this, induction is used more in everyday life as it is harder to obtain a sequential set of facts that are known to be true in deduction.", "d afternoon, could you help me with any internship opportunities for me related to any foreign office, government, local council, or anything related to the government and I had a talk with someone from the university who told me that there are some opportunities that can be done online, because I can only have opportunities located in <city>.<nl><nl>Thank you<nl><nl> <nl><nl>Regards<nl><nl><part_FN><new>Good afternoon, I'd like to register for the <event> on <day> <DDth> <month> at 1pm.<nl>My name is <part_FN_MN_SN><nl>My email address is <email_address> <nl>My University is <university> <nl>My University course is <course> <nl><nl>Thank you <nl><nl>Regards <nl><part_FN><new>Good evening, thank you for all these opportunities emailed.

Creative solutions must be novel and acknowledged by society. The study of creativity consists of the 4 p’s which focuses either on, creative people, creative processes, products of creativity and creative places (environment).<nl>According to the psychometric approach, participants are tested using mental tests for direct measurements. However, such tests often confound intelligence and creativity, because not all creative people are high in IQ. Supporting this theory, Guilford (1956) distinguished between convergent and divergent thinking. He proposed that convergent thinkers find one best solution to a problem whereas, divergent thinkers can lead to many solutions to the same problem. He concluded that, creativity is a form of divergent thinking, because it brings many unrelated ideas together, also known as insight. Therefore, creativity makes use of methods which test divergent thinking such as the \"unusual uses test\" by J.P. Guilford (1967). Although divergent creativity tests are time consuming, they provide accurate measures of creativity than convergence.<nl>Creative Insight can occur in three ways (Sternberg and Davidson, 1982). Firstly, selective encoding refers to most important information being extracted from what is available. Secondly, selective combination is known to be the best way of combining information is perceived. Lastly, selectively comparison, whereby the information for the current problem being solved is related by analogy to a similar problem in one’s past, which often uses mental images (Shepard 1978). Utilising these steps, creativity can be made easier to obtain. <nl>The biographic and autographic approach for creativity is idiosyncratic and makes major use of peer judgments.

It can be concluded that the results supported the theory that cue left would be higher than cue right amplitudes when recording from P3. <nl>Experiment write up, 1200 +- 10% (min1080, max1320) words, titles, title page tables, figures &amp; reference list not included in count<nl>Introduction<nl>The AIH, states that more alpha activity in one hemisphere leads to loss of attention and the disengagement of task irrelevant brain areas (the other hemisphere), this indicates inhibition. Whereas less activity in one hemisphere leads to the opposite; an increase in attention and engagement (Klimesch et al., 2007). Alpha activity or waves are a type of brain wave. They are produced in circumstances of rest, especially when your eyes are closed and happen before you fall asleep (Alpha Waves and How They Help You Sleep, n.d.). <nl>The AIH is supported with research such as (Handel et al., 2011) who used a MEG (magneto-encephalogram) which has better spatial resolution and similar temporal resolution to an EEG for better results. They found that alpha activity is reduced in contralateral brain areas to the stimuli presented, that alpha activity is influenced by attention. <nl>A partial replication of Sauseng et al.’s (2005) experiment: \"A shift of visual spatial attention is selectively associated with human EEG alpha activity\", was conducted to compare alpha amplitudes at P3 between conditions and prove the hypothesis that cue left would be higher than cue right amplitudes when recording from P3. As stimuli always processes contralaterally (opposite side of activity) We wanted to find out whether if, a side of the visual field was cued, would it lead to alpha inhibition on the contralateral side where participants anticipated the stimuli would appear? And which side would show bigger alpha amplitudes?<nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants<nl>38 undergraduate students took part in the research via volunteer sampling, there were originally 39, but one participant’s data were removed as their data were only available for one of the two conditions. <nl>Design<nl>The design of the study was a repeated measure, the independent variable was whether the arrow cues pointed left or right, it also had two levels known as cue left and cue right. The dependent variable was the alpha amplitudes measured in µV (microvolts), recorded from P3.<nl>Materials<nl>A Biopac MP36 was used to collect data and EEG Electrodes were attached to participants’ scalps using AC cream, Everi cream. PsychoPy software was used to present stimuli for a specific period of time and send event markers set to end immediately to Biopac, through a Stimtracker device. The Stimuli used were two white bars on a black background, one large, one small (see figure 1). Two arrows, one pointing left and one pointing right (see figure 2). And white fixation cross (see figure 3). <nl><figure><nl><nl>Procedure<nl>Firstly, the Biopac channel was set up to record raw EEG 0.5-35Hz, digital channels were set up to receive event markers from PsychoPy and Stimtracker, event markers let us know when stimuli were shown. Calculation channels were set up to record activity in the alpha frequency range from 8-13Hz before checking the impedance, with the sampling rate being 1000 Hz, alpha amplitudes were also measured.  Participants had EEG electrodes with AC cream on them placed on their scalps using the 1020 positioning system (Trans-Cranial Techologies.,2012), with P3 being recorded. The active electrode was placed at P3, the reference electrode was attached to Fz, an earth electrode was attached to the forehead near the hairline and everything was measured relative to Cz.The areas were scrubbed with Everi cream beforehand for better adhesion. They were then asked to complete a cued visual attention task using PsychoPy. <nl>Cued with a fixation cross at the centre of the screen for 34ms an arrow indicating whether it would be the left or right side of the visual field the target, would appear, in the centre of the screen for 34ms whilst participants were asked by the experimenter to focus their attention to that side of the visual field. There was 50% chance of being cued left or right. There were different event markers for cue left and right conditions and they were sent at stimulus onset. There were 20 blocks of 4 trial types, each block had cued right small bar, cued left small bar, cued right large bar, and cued left large bar) randomised within blocks with half of trials cued left and half cued right. <nl><nl>Results<nl>The raw 9-13Hz Alpha EEG data for each condition was analysed using the event markers sent from PsychoPy to identify when the stimuli would be presented. We looked at the period of 200ms of recorded activity before stimulus presentation, after arrow cues had been shown and used Biopac by rectifying and averaging over 50 samples of raw alpha data to show alpha activity regardless of whether it was excitatory or inhibitory. This smooths out the data (averaging over samples), reduces the impact of outlyingextreme values and converts negative values to positive, so we get an average deviation from 0 in microvolts. <nl>Statistical Analysis<nl>Table 1 shows that the rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA) were higher in the cue left condition than the cue right condition. According to the Wilcoxon signed rank test, the difference was significant, and the inferential statistics are as follows (t=566, n=38, p&lt;0.005). <nl><nl>Discussion<nl>The results were significant, so we used a non-parametric test to find the inferential statistics from the data collected. The results fit with the hypothesis as the results are consistent with AIH as recorded activity from P3cue left were higher than cue right, which were the task irrelevant brain areas, suggesting that alpha suppression happened there.<nl>Methodological issues that could have affected the results could have been varying levels of impedance, associated with more variance in the measurements but would affect both conditions equally. Another methodological issue that could have affected results could have been artefacts, such as blinking, that would affect the waves. From the experiment overall, I conclude that the AIH is highly supported by research as it has high temporal reliability, and despite all the methodological issues, the results are still valid.\"", "dad.

Economic, cultural and legal integration will be examined to evaluate their impact on the overall success of the European Union, drawing on citizens' opinion, empirical evidence of success and criticisms of each area. However, it will finally conclude that peace across the continent is facilitated by cultural integration. Whilst economic integration prevents declarations of war, it is the individual citizens, brought together through cultural integration that allows for a closer union. Whilst co-dependence and economic reliance upon other nations prevents the declaration of war due to shared economic and monetary policies, which was established by the creation of the European Coal and Steel community in 1951. Ultimately, cultural integration reduces opposition to further economic and legal integration across EU members as they grow closer to the idea of a ‘European identity’. This will further be proven by the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the European Union, of which a large proportion of the factors that contributed to the result are cultural. Drawing a comparison with other regional organisations and their failures highlights the success of the EU project, particularly with its peacekeeping efforts, and will ultimately conclude that cultural integration is more important to peace and security than economic integration in today’s European society. <nl><nl>Economic integration began with the Treaty of Paris, signed in 1951 to merge economic ties of 6 European countries to create the ECSC. The objective of this treaty was to prevent the outbreak of war by the nations becoming economically interdependent with one another (McCormick, 2015). The ‘Schuman plan’ did aim to spillover the concepts of the ECSC to all other aspects of the economy. This ECSC evolved to become the EEC, after the Treaty of Rome was signed in 1957, with the effects coming into force in January the following year. The objective was to allow free movement of goods, services, capital and people; the main motivation was to ‘avoid any return to national protectionism’ (Bulmer et al, 2017). Despite the creation of a single market resulting in uneven benefits and disadvantages for each member, all six countries believed their economies would be better off in such a community, even if there were disproportionalities. Stagflation in the 1970’s limited the growth of the EEC, and by the mid-80’s a new plan for the future of the union was set out by Delors in response to the global economic climate. The white papers set a deadline of 1992 for the measures outlined to be enacted in each member state. The measures heavily referred to as ‘the 4 freedoms’; capital, services, goods and labour, achieved by removing physical, fiscal and technical barriers to movement between inter-EU borders. <nl><nl>With the history of economic integration outlined above, the advantages must be evaluated in order to answer the question. Benefits of a single market include the following; reduced production costs, lower prices for consumers, transfer of knowledge and skills, trade creation and co-operation on common projects by pooling skills, labour, knowledge and materials. These benefits ultimately mean that EU citizens have greater job opportunities, less expensive goods, and in some cases more advanced technology due the pooling of knowledge and materials. <nl><nl>Further integration across the European union progressed with the creation of the Eurozone. The Economic and Monetary Union became an objective in 1969, coming to fruition in 1999, with the introduction of the Euro currency. The single currency creates benefits for its citizens in that it provides more economic stability, lower costs as currency would no longer need to be converted and a stronger presence in the global economy. The introduction of the currency undoubtedly brings the union closer together, however there are a number of disadvantages of adopting a single currency. The largest being that monetary policy that covers a large, diverse area consisting of a number of nations, does not always fit local economic conditions. Economic conditions consider unemployment rates and inflation rates, standard Keynesian economic policy involves the increase or decrease of interest rates in order to prevent economic crash or to stimulate the economy. Connected to this issue, we will reflect on the Eurozone crisis of 2009 and evaluate to what extent the implementation of the single currency is successful. <nl><nl>Problems associated with a single currency are that it limits fiscal policy, and interest rates set are not optimal for every area. Both of these problems contributed in some way to the Eurozone crisis. According to Wijffelaars and Loman, the two causes of the eurozone crisis were the lack of effective mechanisms andor institutions to prevent the build-up of macro-economic institutions to effectively absorb shocks (Wijffelaars and Loman, 2015). However, in balance, the introduction of the euro promotes trade and encourages investment and has ultimately furthered economic integration across the European Union. In addition, according to Risse, the introduction of a physical currency shared with multiple nations across the union acts as a symbol of integration. The daily use of euro notes and coins reinforces the idea of a European identity (Risse, cited in Bulmer et al, 2017). <nl><nl>To elaborate further on the concept of ‘European identity’, this section of the essay will now focus on the impact of cultural integration in maintaining peace across Europe. Firstly, one must discuss the relationship between national identities and European identities. According to Ultan, the 2 identities have a close relationship. Whilst national identity is the most important and strongest, it is possible to have multiple identities, such as European (Ultan, 2016). By adopting a ‘European identity’, citizens can move slightly further away from nationalism (an important goal of the entire European integration project), and will be more likely to align themselves with EU policies and not just their own national policies (Ultan, 2016). The integration process for each country differs depending on the states’ traditions and cultures, but the same goal of assimilation to European culture is a fundamental objective to increase support for EU membership. <nl><nl>The Treaty of Rome signed in 1957 had no mention of culture or any form of cultural integration (Ultan, 2016), it was only with the signing of the Maastricht treaty in 1992 that this area of integration was considered and first mentioned. The Maastricht treaty set out the concept of European Citizenship, which grants rights to citizens of each member state including consular protection and freedom to live, work, and travel freely in other member states. According to the Eurobarometer survey conducted by the European commission, which surveys the opinion of 33,000 European citizens across all member states, shows that 68% feel that ‘they are a citizen of the EU’ (Stone, 2017). With the majority of the population identifying as a European citizen, it is clear to suggest that this area of integration has been successful. The ability for citizens of EU member states to move across borders to work, travel and live freely not only gives one a feeling of citizenship but also that the different nations are together as one. According to the European Commission, the freedom of movement is regarded by the majority of EU citizens as the greatest achievement of European integration (European Commission, 2019). <nl><nl>Ultan also identifies several important factors that are responsible for the success of cultural integration in Europe. The shared history, common religion and geography all have a direct impact on the integration process as they aid to create an identity that those across Europe can relate to. In his paper, Ultan also suggests that across Europe, citizens are ‘bound by their diversity’ (Ultan, 2016) and that in the creation of a European identity there should be respect for the fact there are a wide range of cultures, traditions and languages. This is reflected in article 6 of the Amsterdam Treaty, ‘ The Union shall respect the national identities of its Member States’. As Ultan suggests, promoting individual member states' cultural diversity results in respect for other nation’s culture (Ultan, 2016). Ultimately, this brings the union closer by means of respect and acceptance. <nl><nl>To further argue the importance of an established European identity, the example of Brexit can be drawn upon to suggest that the member state must recognise being European is a wider extension of their national identity; and not two separate identities which are at war with one another. It must be noted that the UK has always had difficulty aligning themselves with the rest of Europe, beginning with the reluctance to join what was then the ECSC, but eventually joining in 1973. The idea that the UK views Europe as the ‘other’ naturally creates Euroscepticism, which has been prevalent in the UK for decades; and became popularised during the leave campaign in 2016 (Murray Stewart Leith et al, 2019). According to the Eurobarometer survey, the (now previous) member state which views their national identity as exclusive was the UK, meaning that the majority of the UK’s population were unable to identify as European and suggesting that the national identity and the European identity are in conflict. With the result of the 2016 EU referendum in mind, one can assume that the idea of a European identity is fundamental for maintaining support for the union. Murray Stewart Leith et al suggest that the reason for ‘lukewarm feelings’ of Britons towards the EU is due to the fact that there has not been a national circumstance where joining the EU seemed necessary to solve the issue; unlike in a number of other EU member states (Murray Stewart Leith et al, 2019). For example. Germany’s desire to join the EU was to create a more integrated Europe and to reconstruct it’s national identity after the second world war, and Italy wanting a more stable political structure which the EU could offer (Murray Stewart Leith et al, 2019). The lack of European identity directly correlates with the lack of support for EU membership, and whilst this can be considered a major factor in the outcome of the referendum, the EU is not concerned that this feeling is spreading across the continent. The Eurobarameter survey conducted after the result in 2017 shows the support of citizens for the EU is actually at an all time high. It could be perhaps suggested, that Brexit has made the EU and the feeling of being European stronger for the remaining member states. <nl><nl>Further integration is necessary for maintaining a strong union and preserving peace, by increasing areas of integration and promoting the notion of a European identity, the EU can ensure its success in peacekeeping. The increase of integration across several areas can be explained by the neofunctionalist theory. This theory presents the argument that when one area is integrated, further pressure by actors can be exerted in other areas- causing a ‘spillover effect’. It’s relevance in theorizing the EU has diminished since the 1980’s, but does however explain the transition from the ECSC to the EEC. The debate surrounding integration theories for the EU are still ongoing, but many do stress the importance of supranational institutions in furthering European integration. <nl><nl>An area of integration, whilst not the most important to preserving peace by maintaining stability, but certainly an area that provides means of which other areas of integration can occur, is legal integration. The European Court of Justice upholds European law introduced by other institutions of the union. The ECJ acts as a supranational institution, and has jurisdiction in all member states, ruling on interpretation of the treaties. According to Garrett, governments largely accept the rulings of the ECJ, and the ECJ as a strategic rational actor rules taking into account anticipated reactions of the governments (Garrett, 1995). Understanding why institutions like the ECJ are important to integration across the European union can be thought of ‘integration through law’, intertwining European law into national law bounds all its citizens by common rule. Whilst each member state can implement its own national laws, it must enforce the laws introduced by the EU. According to Augenstein, ‘the legal system posits or presents the identity of the political community’ (Augenstein, 2012), thus inferring that the enforcement of law across all member states builds a sense of community and reinforces the idea of a European identity. <nl><nl>The aforementioned successes of areas of integration speak for themselves in that they are great achievements not only for each member nation’s economies, but for every single European citizen at an individual level. The unique success of the EU project shines its achievements across all areas of integration. However, in order to address the question, this essay will now focus on why peacekeeping is the single greatest achievement. <nl><nl>By comparing the EU and its peacekeeping efforts with that of regional organizations in the Middle East, the achievements of integration and peacekeeping in Europe can be highlighted and clearly identified. The Arab League and the Gulf Cooperation Council, created in 1945 and 1981 respectively, are two regional organisations in the Middle East established with similar aims as those of Schuman when the ECSC was created in Europe. The aim was to begin economic integration amongst the member states, and to mediate any regional conflicts without foreign assistance. Largely, both these organisations have been unsuccessful. According to Pinfari, the Gulf cooperation council ‘systematically failed to mediate effectively in major conflicts in the Gulf’ (Pinfari, 2009). Pinfari concluded his analysis of the success and failures of the Arab league and GCC by saying that claiming the entire project as a failure is ‘ungenerous’, yet the organisations do not have effective control on conflict resolution (Pinfari, 2009). It can also be argued that the Arab states have an inability to sacrifice their state sovereignty to a regional pool, whereas this has been done in Europe and ultimately allows the union to be successful. It could perhaps be argued that instability in the region can be largely blamed by the volatile and complicated history of the Middle East, however the continent of Europe has also had its fair share of historical violent conflicts. The success of the institutions created to maintain a strong bond between member states is especially highlighted when contrasted with the Arab league. The strongest evidence of success being that the EU was honoured by the Nobel committee in 2012 for ‘over six decades contributed to the advancement of peace and reconciliation, democracy and human rights in Europe’ (The Nobel Peace Prize 2012, 2020). <nl><nl>To conclude, the single greatest achievement of the European Union is peacekeeping between member states, but this has only been preserved due to strong economic and cultural integration. Both areas of integration are fundamental to peacekeeping; economic integration forms ties between states at the governmental level, but cultural integration forms the ties (and builds support for the union) at an individual level. Support for the evergrowing union must come from the individual citizens of each state, not just the governments. This was proven with Brexit, where the lack of European identity amongst its citizens resulted in a vote to leave the union, despite the government’s support for membership. This is why the EU project has been so successful, because each citizen benefits from the EU, not only economically, but also in that they have the right to travel, work and live across the continent. By providing citizens with several benefits, the support for the union increases. One would argue that cultural integration is more important to ensuring peace as not only does it prevent opposition for further economic integration but it also creates the idea of a single European identity. So to answer the question, economic integration is not the EU’s greatest achievement; but that is not to say it is not important or extremely beneficial to member state governments and European citizens. Whilst economic integration was the primary goal when the ECSC was created, today the union requires deeper integration in order to survive and preserve peace. The conclusion that the single greatest accomplishment of the EU project is peacekeeping derives from the simple fact that since the establishment of the ECSC, which has evolved to become the EU we know today, there has not been a continental outbreak of war, and peace between EU member states has been maintained. The aims set out by the Schuman plan have been fulfilled as Europe has not been involved in any intercontinental war, breaking a cycle of continuous conflict since the 16th century (Ette, 2016).", " u bipolar 💀<new>Shutup<new>Are u goood bro<new>Nah maynnnn<new>My fone died and then I died<new>I misssss u 😌<new>Why what’s wrong<new>Are u okay ??<new>What happened ?<new>Are u ok?<new>Bad<new>How u feeling<new>Love it<new>And a fat head<new>😌<new>U do boo<new>Don’t doubt urself<new>Ain’t started today<new>Wyd<new>Yhhhh<new>Wyd<new>Awww that’s good u can chill a little<new>Don’t avoid me g<new>Morning 🤕<new>Hey<new>My dad just gave me lemsip<new>Just drinking<new>Wyd<new>Yah<new>I want to but if u don’t mind getting ill<new>:)<new>Good don’t complain later x<new>😌🥰<new>U asked<new>Gimme 5 hours x<new>Nah I’ll be out in 1.5 don’t cry xx<new>Yh<new>Bro I literally slept long today"]}
{"id": "5ee4e313-c7ad-4dc6-ab91-af313c39e55a", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Both the biological and psychoanalytic approaches seek to explain human behaviour. The biological approach proposes the idea that all psychological problems are rooted in physiological causes, whereas the psychoanalytic approach suggests that behaviour is due to unconscious forces and childhood experiences. The key features of these approaches are distinct from each other and have their uses and limitations, yet, both are still widely used in psychology. <nl><nl>The biological approach prevails over other psychological approaches due to the fact that its explanations encompass anatomy, physiology and the role of neurological function. This approach accepts the idea of materialism as it assumes that all behaviour has a physical basis. This opposes the previously accepted idea of dualism, in which it was believed that the body and the mind are separate but interacting entities. The shift from dualism to materialism was supported with work by Paul Broca (1861). In studying a patient called ‘Tan’, Broca discovered that there was a direct link between the articulation of speech and damage to a particular cortical region. This area was later named ‘Broca’s area’ and pioneered the idea that particular cognitive functions can be localised to areas in the cerebral cortex (Grodzinsky &amp; Amunts, 2006). <nl><nl>Localisation of brain function is a central concept to the biological approach. Broca (1861) and Wernicke’s (1874) findings were some of the first to show that damage to cortical areas produces a change in language. A significant drawback of these findings was that they were concluded from limited post-mortem evidence, which makes it difficult to show the specificity of location. The mechanism of speech may be something that is controlled by multiple areas, so damage to any one of these areas may produce the same effect (Myers, 2007). <nl><nl>Recent research by Delgado and Hamlin (1956) demonstrated how stimulation of the motor cortex using electrodes led to specific physical reactions. In one individual the left motor cortex was stimulated, and it was found that the right fist would clench. This provided support for the latter idea that the cerebral cortex is split into four lobes, each relating to a different function (Carlson &amp; Birkett, 2017). <nl><nl>Another feature of the biological perspective is the idea of brain communication through the use of neurotransmitters. These chemicals are involved in regulating processes in the body such as emotion. If there is a biochemical imbalance in these systems, this may in turn affect human behaviour. A review by Seo and Patrick (2008) demonstrated how a deficiency in serotonin combined with high levels of dopamine interact together in the prefrontal cortex and may predispose individuals to aggressive behaviour. This follows the diathesis-stress model in stating how irregularities in biological systems may predispose individuals to certain conditions which manifest after being triggered. This shows that contrary to general assumption, the biological approach does not entirely ignore the role of nature in human behaviour. It acknowledges that biology may be just the precursor to abnormal behaviour. <nl><nl>Empiricism is an essential component in understanding the functioning behind biological systems. Experiments such as Delgado and Hamlin, (1956) and Seo and Patrick, (2008) show that being deeply embedded in the observational methods of science provides an advantage of the biological approach over others. This level of empiricism means that studies can be easily replicated. Likewise, the possibility of direct manipulation of a variable and the observation of the response means that valid conclusions can be drawn. From this, researchers are then able to take away evidence that helps support concepts such as neurotransmitter effects. <nl><nl>As the biological approach follows the law of parsimony, it often finds itself being criticised for being too reductionist. Complex behaviour is simplified down to individual physiological mechanisms. For example, the concept of being able to produce language is reduced to the interactions between neurones in the frontal lobe when the explanation behind this may be far more intricate. This approach is also deterministic as biological processes are exempt from our free will. If aggression is due to neurotransmitter abnormality, this suggests that there is no control over the behaviour exhibited. However, evidence by Van Lier, Vitaro and Eisner (2007) has shown how peer rejection in children can lead to maladaptive behaviours, including aggression. This demonstrates how an environmental rather than a biological factor can lead to an individual choosing to express their aggressive behaviour. <nl><nl>An alternative to this is the psychoanalytic approach which was developed by Sigmund Freud in 1896. One of the concepts Freud introduced was that personality development is moulded by childhood experiences and fixations, namely the psychosexual stages of development. He theorised that all children go through the oral, anal, phallic, latency and genital stages in which the individual is focused on obtaining pleasure through the specific areas. In each of these stages, there is the possibility for fixation to occur. If this occurs at any stage, personality development into adulthood may be affected (Fennald, 1997). A second concept is that personality is split into the id, ego and superego which are unconscious forces that influence our decisions and motives. The id contains sexual instincts (libido) and aggressive instincts (Eysenck, 1988). The superego reflects the moral standards of society, restricting the id from making decisions which would not be allowed and the ego is the decision maker, mediating between the two (Jarvis, 2000). <nl>There is substantial contemporary evidence to suggest that Freud was correct in some of his propositions, like his idea of unconscious cognitive processes. Research by Westen (1999) looks to explain how the activation of particular unconscious associative networks influences ongoing thoughts, feelings and behaviour outside our awareness. Westen theorised that when networks associated with a particular situation are activated, this spreads to other neural networks and increases the likelihood of interpreting a situation in a certain way. This supports Freud’s idea by showing how a previous experience, stored in the unconscious, is able to influence future interactions. <nl><nl>The psychoanalytic approach has advantages over the biological approach by taking a multifaceted view and acknowledging both sides of the nature-nurture debate. The role of nature is considered in how innate drives influence our thoughts, and the role of nurture in how childhood experiences elicit behaviour. Consequently, this approach has similarities with the biological in assuming determinism. Behaviour in adult life is affected by the fixation of libido which suggests that we are shaped by irrepressible forces that are exempt from free will. <nl><nl>The scientific status of the psychoanalytic approach is called into question on multiple occasions which puts it at a disadvantage to the biological approach. Variables are not manipulated, which makes it difficult to produce causal conclusions, and therefore leads to issues with the falsifiability. Freud’s theories were based upon untested observations in a purely therapeutic situation. Qualitative research derived from case studies are a less reliable source of information and Freud only used 12 over the lifespan of his published work (Eysenck, 2000). However, more contemporary research by Fonagy and Bateman (1999) has shown how the psychoanalytic approach has evolved over time to incorporate more controlled data-gathering methods. In order to test the effectiveness of psychoanalytically oriented partial hospitalisation as a treatment for borderline personality disorder (BPD), Fonagy and Bateman (1999) conducted a randomised control trial and assessed outcome measures such as number of admissions, frequency of suicide attempts and symptom distress. There was a well-structured methodological approach to this study, including the use of DSM-III-R criteria to assess for BPD before participants were randomly assigned to the two groups. This study is an example of how the psychoanalytic approach should not be completely disregarded as non-scientific as current research looks to improve the legitimacy of methods that are used. <nl><nl>In conclusion, the biological and the psychoanalytic approach parallel each other in terms of their determinism and their perspective on nature. However, the biological approach has an advantage over the psychoanalytic approach as it is empirical and has a strong scientific basis which supports its credibility. <nl><nl>The early concepts of the psychoanalytic approach are difficult to falsify but on the other hand, contemporary psychoanalytic research has since developed to include more rigorous scientific procedures. Despite issues with both approaches, key features have their place in psychology today with localisation of brain function, the action of neurotransmitters and unconscious cognitive processes still being widely accepted.", "<addr12_FN>, <nl><nl>Thank you for your time last week. <nl><nl>I would like to continue begin working with you. <nl><nl>When is available? <nl><nl><part_NN><new>Hi <addr12_FN>,<nl><nl>That would be perfect, thank you!<nl><nl>Best wishes,<nl><part_NN><new>Good morning <addr12_FN>,<nl><nl>Hope that you are well.<nl><nl>Unfortunately I have woken up to a family emergency this morning so I will not be able to make our session.

However, the biological approach has an advantage over the psychoanalytic approach as it is empirical and has a strong scientific basis which supports its credibility. <nl><nl>The early concepts of the psychoanalytic approach are difficult to falsify but on the other hand, contemporary psychoanalytic research has since developed to include more rigorous scientific procedures. Despite issues with both approaches, key features have their place in psychology today with localisation of brain function, the action of neurotransmitters and unconscious cognitive processes still being widely accepted.", "y better than they was earlier<new>Yeye maybe<new>But I think they ok<new>Booking train tix to arrive on <DDth> <month_abbr> at 2pm and arrive back to <city> by 5:15 on <day><new>Ok, do u mean go to <city> on <DD><DDth> ?<new>Or u go to <city><new>Ohhhh okay makes sense<new>Ye sounds bless<new>Awh he loves my wardrobe<new>Is he back yet?<new>Dw he'll be fine<new>🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺<new>Soz was showering<new>Ooooohhh awh<new>Arrives at <station> at 1:41pm<new>Yeye dw<new>Meet at <station> and wander around!<new>Um ok<new>Okr<new>Meet at <station><new>And I don't mind going anywhere<new>Pls dony😂😭<new>Leave at 820"]}

{"id": "369dfedc-bdc7-49e6-a9db-fdefe356dd2e", "discourse_types": ["essay", "text_message"], "pair": ["Mandler’s model of the adult semantic system is an explanation of concept development that discusses three claims. Firstly, the fundamental distinction between the core categories; animals’ vs non-animals, secondly; the system is organised hierarchically, and finally, the system is categorically organised from its inception. This essay will evaluate the evidence supporting and disputing Mandler’s second and third claims, with emphasis on the latter in attempt to understand adult cognitive functions. <nl><nl>Beginning with the third claim; the semantic system is categorically organised from its inception. Habituation paradigms have been used to examine this implication, using very young infants to investigate distinctions between biological and non-biological motions. Research (Bertenthal et al., 1987) (Simion, Regolin, &amp; Bulf, 2008) has demonstrated young infants’ sensitivity and ability to distinguish between the two motions, therefore suggesting an innate predisposition for this ability, and have highlighted how this distinction is made before language acquisition. Therefore, supporting Mandler’s third claim, whilst also providing supporting evidence for Mandler’s first claim; that distinctions are made animals vs non-animals. The convergence of evidence supports the validity of the conclusions made.  However, such research can be criticised in respects to the validity of the methodology. Habituation techniques rely on reengagement of attention when presented with a new stimulus. The result of the young infants’ habituation and dishabituation may be caused by a perceptual difference, not a conceptual one. A view supported by Sloutsky (2003) who argued infants are good at detecting perceptual similarity but do not have conceptual understanding. When investigating the categorical organisation of the semantic system, habituation paradigms fail to answer at what point this process begins, which challenges Mandler’s third claim, consequently presenting an argument that categorical organisation does not begin as early as Mandler perhaps suggests. Therefore, we can ask, at what point does this early category organisation begin.<nl><nl>To examine this, we must look at Mandler’s second claim; the system is organised hierarchically. There is much debate regarding which depiction of early category organisations is more accurate. There are two main hypothesises which debate the hierarchical organisation.<nl>Rosch (1978) argues a basic-level hypothesis, and suggests we learn concepts in a bottom-up order. The basic-level is the first conceptual level, it focuses on within-category similarity and between-category dissimilarity. Later in development, the superordinate-level emerges and following that, the subordinate-level. The basic-level occupies a privileged position in the hierarchy in semantic cognition (Rosch, 1978), (Bauer &amp; Just, 2017). Supporting experimental research (Daehler, Lonardo &amp; Bukatko 1979) has found infants made basic-level matches more easily than superordinate ones, and case study research (Clark, 1973) has found children’s first words for objects are often basic-level. The triangulation of methods used across the research supporting the basic-level hypothesis suggests consistency across findings and validates their conclusions. That said, this theory cannot explain the linguistic biases children may be influenced by; when adults label stimuli for children, it is often at the basic-level i.e. adults are more likely use the label ‘bed’ rather than furniture (superordinate-level) or sofa bed (subordinate). This infers that such organisation is possibly guided through linguistic influences and not through bottom up processing as thought.<nl>On the contrary, Mandler has provided an alternative depiction of early category taxonomies; the global-conceptions hypothesis. Using a top-down approach, claims an infant’s first conceptual categories are not at the basic-level, but at a global level which resemble superordinate domains, however there are no basic-level classes within them. Supported through her experimental research using object examination tasks (Mandler &amp; MacDonough 1993), it was found superordinate distinctions were made (animals vs vehicles) in young infants but basic-level contrasts were not (dog vs fish). A criticism regarding the validity of this research is made by Jones &amp; Smith (1993) who argue for the importance of perceptually rich stimuli to be used in concept developmental studies. Real dogs and real fish obtain different features to that of a toy version, i.e. smells, textures and sizes. This research lacks mundane realism. Therefore, assuming the distinctions cannot be made between the basic-level contrast is arguably invalid. It is also important to state how negative results for a basic-level hypothesis does not create positive results for the global-conceptions hypothesis.<nl>Reflecting upon the research presented, there is no clear answer to which hypothesis is correct; both present insightful explanations into early categorical organisation and adult cognitive functioning. Neither hypothesis however address the issue regarding perceptual vs conceptual organisation; do infants and children have a conceptual understanding of stimuli or can they just acknowledge their perceptual differences. <nl><nl><nl>Further critiquing Mandler’s third claim in regard to the implication of early categorical organisation being prior to language acquisition. Asking at which point language interferes with conceptual organisation may provide an answer to when we are able to distinguish between perceptual differences and conceptual understanding.<nl>The role of perceptual similarity in categorisation has been investigated by Gelman and Coley (1990) who used typical and atypical category members and looked at the influence of linguistic support upon the judgements made by 2-year olds. They found appearance controls judgement about category membership in absence of linguistic support in young children, however when provided with labels, category membership rather than perceptual appearance guides the interferences about category properties. From this, we can assume older infants obtain a conceptual understanding regardless of perceptual inferences due to linguistic guidance. An important factor of this research is challenging prototypicality of categories, and the influences it has upon children in their conceptual development when organising. It could be argued that prototypicality of prior research into early categorisation may disguise children’s distinctions between perception and conception, suggesting the ability to distinguish may be sooner than this research indicates, supporting Mandler’s third claim. <nl><nl><nl>In conclusion, this essay suggests the research evidence into concept development has greatly contributed to understanding adults cognitive functioning. However, there is a gap in the literature regarding at which stage infants can truly distinguish between conceptual understanding and perceptual differences. One weakness of this evaluation is the research discussed only considers that of typical development and ignores atypical developmental outcomes.", " know you’ll have to really properly look after your teeth now, like drink all drinks but water with a straw and make sure you brush and floss more than normal <new>Otherwise they’ll charge you and it’s SO expensive <new>Good <new>I know you will <new>I printed some pics <new>I took them and printed them<new>No you don’t x<new>Because someone I know broke her phone and lost all her photos so I printed loads of mine off<new>Yeah <new>Nice lights <new>Hey bitch <new>What’s up with you <new>any gossip<new>How PENG does this look<new>Same it looks so good<new>Did you watch the video "]}
{"id": "0b3cb508-f09b-4913-8749-75c097e4cb65", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["\"Autism Spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder (Hodges et al, 2020). A diagnosis of ASD according to the DSM-IV-TR entails a minimum of two social impairments, one communication and one in restricted and repetitive behaviours (RRB) (American Psychiatric association, 1994). The ‘Big 3’ psychological theories are Theory of Mind (ToM); Weak Central Coherence (WCC) and executive dysfunction (ED).<nl>ToM is the ability to attribute mental states to oneself and others (Tager-Flusberg, 2006). 80% of children with ASD, failed the Sally Anne false belief task (which investigates ToM) (Baren-Cohen, Leslie &amp; Frith, 1985) compared to typically developing (TD) children. However, 20% of children still passed. This doesn’t account for performances by higher-functioning individuals with autism (HFAI), as Happe (1995) states passing false-belief tasks are predicted by verbal mental age. Furthermore, Happe’s 1994 strange stories test found individuals with autism (IWA) showed difficulties with irony, sarcasm, and metaphors. This can account for social and communicative impairments such as sustaininginitiating 2-way conversations, subsequently causing  failure to develop peer relationships. However, this may be due to under-connectivity in left-hemispheres (Verley et al, 2014). In addition, IWA also showed difficulty in reading eyes tasks (Baren-Cohen et al, 2001), which suggests impairments of joint attention (JA). Furthermore, children with autism, have impairments in following eyes andor giving appropriate eye contact (Neumann, 2006), as well as issues using declarative gestures. Baron-Cohen (1994) stated this was due to a deficit in shared attention, according to mind-reading system. This can explain social and communication impairments e.g., lack of shared enjoyment and failure to use non-verbal behaviours. However, ToM fails to account for RRB such as a tendency for routinesrules and circumscribed interests. <nl>ED involves deficits in planning, inhibition, and cognitive flexibility (Rajendran &amp; Mitchell, 2007). IWA show poor cognitive flexibility in the Wisconsin card sorting task (WCST) (Nelson, 1976). This can be due to perseverative behaviour. However, Minshew et al (1992) found perseverative ability is linked to verbal IQ as they found no differences between TD and HFAI. Thus, ED cannot solely and universally explain deficits. Furthermore, IWA have planning deficits illustrated in Tower of Hanoi task (Ozonoff &amp; Jensen, 1999). However, Hughes (1996) found IWA were able to do puzzles requiring  fewer steps. Although planning isn’t completely impaired, disruption of routinesrules causes distress to IWA (Rajendran &amp; Mitchell, 2007).<nl>Studies aforementioned do not account for individual differences, as performances may be different in HFAI due to  Verbal IQ. Furthermore, ED also occurs in individuals with schizophrenia and Tourette’s who perform similarly to IWA on executive function tests (Rajendran &amp; Mitchell, 2007).  This limits the potential of ED as a diagnostic marker for ASD. <nl>The Weak Central Coherence theory (WCC) (Frith, 1989) states IWA possess a bias towards local elements. Evidence for this is in embedded figures (Witkin, 1971) and block design tasks (Shah &amp; Frith, 1983), in which children with ASD displayed superior performance. Furthermore, Happe (1996) found IWA weren’t susceptible to visual illusions. These local biases can account for IWA showing pre-occupations for parts of objects. In further support, Hobson &amp; Lee (1998) found IWA do not process faces as a whole as they weren’t susceptible to inversion effect, due to this local bias processing. Furthermore, IWA show activity in primary visual cortex, linked to perception (Chung &amp; Son, 2020) which can explain performances, therefore, WCC isn’t a sole explanation for superior performances. Frith &amp; Snowling (1983) found IWA failed to use appropriate associations on homograph tasks, as they focused on sole words instead of the whole context, further supporting WCC. This can explain social communicative impairments such as sustaining conversation or developing relationships. Although, Lopez &amp; Leekam (2003) found IWA were able to use appropriate word associations in their visual homograph task suggesting such deficits are sensitive to task modalities.  <nl>In conclusion, the ‘Big 3’ psychological theories contribute to the ASD clinical profile to an extent.  ToM can account for social and communicative impairments, but not universally, as well as inability to explain RRB. Although, EDT can account for RRB i.e., adherence to routinesrules, is not exclusive to ASD. The WCC accounts for social and non-social behaviours but brain regions also play a role. This shows ASD is a multiple deficit disorder without a one theory fits all. The fractionation theory suggests the 3 domains are distinct at a cognitive level (Happe &amp; Ronald, 2008), but Russell et al (1991) states there is overlap between all domains highlighted in performances and theories, thus further research is need on domain specificity.<nl><nl><question2><nl>Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit atypical behaviours compared to typically developing individuals (TD). Lower-level processes such as  enhanced perceptual functioning (EPF); social motivational theory (SMT) and spontaneous mimicry (SM) may account for such differences.<nl>Evidence for EPF arises from embedded figures task (Witkin et al, 1971), as well as block design tasks (Shah &amp; Frith, 1983) in which children with ASD show superior performance to TD. In block design tasks, children with autism also show no further advantage to pre-segmented designs. This is due to perceptual processes being enhanced in ASD, which leads to locally orientateddetailed focused perception, compared to weak central coherence (WCC) which outlines a bias towards local elements (Charman et al, 2013). Thus, EPF highlights superiority in perceptual processing compared to processing style in WCC. Furthermore, IWA perform faster than TD children on conjunctive visual search tasks (Plaisted, O’Riordan &amp; Baron-Cohen, 1998) which further supports IWA have enhanced perceptual discrimination (Plaisted, O’Riordan &amp; Baron-Cohen, 1998) as EPF enables IWA to discriminate against colours and features resulting  in this faster processing. <nl>EPF can also explain savant skills, which are more common in ASD than the general population (Mottron et al, 2006), which highlights strengths of ASD. For example, exceptional drawing skills are due to EPF, as this encourages IWA to avoid perceptual closure, leading to more accurate and detailed focused drawings (Chamberlain et al, 2013). However, EPF doesn’t explain why this only occurs in some IWA, as there may be individual variations in processing perceptual information. <nl>EPF can also explain atypicality in sensory symptoms in IWA. Due to this enhanced perceptual processing, the threshold of detecting sensations is lowered (Lawson et al, 2015). However, Triomphe et al (2019) found IWA have atypical Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) modulation (linked to inhibition) which also explains tactile hypersensitivity in ASD. Therefore, EPF isn’t a sole explanation of why hypersensitivity occurs in IWA. Another limitation is EPF fails to explain why hyposensitivity occurs, and thus has weak explanatory power regarding sensory processing. <nl>Another low-level process in ASD is SM.  In electromyography responses in IWA, SM of emotional expressions is shown to be atypical (Beall et al, 2008) andor delayed (Oberman, Winkielman &amp; Ramachandran, 2009). SM is important for socio-emotional reciprocity, as Chartrand and Bargh (1999) found being mimicked makes people like us more. SM also underlies empathy (Drimalla et al, 2019). Therefore, this can explain impairments in developing relationships in ASD as well as a  lack of shared enjoyment displayed in ASD as IWA prefer to play on their own (Chevallier et al, 2012). <nl>The SMT explains deficits in social cognition related to lower-level processes.  Eye-tracking experiments by Klin et al (2002) found children with ASD look more at the background than characters in static social photographs. Furthermore, Vlamings et al (2010) found IWA have impairments in processing and identifying faces. According to EPF, this is due to enhanced processing of high spatial frequency information, an atypical process focusing on fine perceptual detail. However, the SMT states IWA  have less motivation to attend to faces as it is less rewarding, and this lack of experience can lead to poorer processing (Chevallier et al, 2012).<nl>Furthermore, Chamberlain, Rothman-Fuller and Kasari (2007) found children with ASD prefer isolated tasks compared to collaborative. Chevallier et al (2012) found this is due to selective social anhedonia (inability to feel social pleasure) in adolescents with ASD and this correlates with ASD severity. This explains impaired initiating and responding to in children with ASD in joint attention.   <nl>In conclusion, the above theories can contribute to atypical differences in ASD. EPF can explain atypical differences at a social and non-social level in ASD. SMT involves deficits in orienting to social information and behaviours which maintain social interaction (Chevallier et al, 2012), explaining social and communication impairments. Although, this cannot account for atypical restricted and repetitive behaviours (RRB) shown in IWA. In addition, despite SM being able to explain atypical social behaviours, it fails to explain communication and RRB. Failing to  account for a whole domain shown in IWA entirely shows serious limitations in using these theories for an explanatory power of the full ASD clinical profile. Furthermore, evidence given in support of these studies are task-dependent and artificial, such as eye-tracking and facial processing experiments as they do not reflect real-life settings. Likewise, lab studies lack validity and therefore may not be extrapolated. The above theories aren’t universal across all IWA as individual variations occur due to it being a spectrum disorder, as well as co-morbidity. Further research needs to be conducted on individual variations on atypical differences.<nl><nl><question3><nl>Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit atypical behaviours compared to typically developing individuals (TD). Lower-level processes such as  enhanced perceptual functioning (EPF); social motivational theory (SMT) and spontaneous mimicry (SM) may account for such differences.<nl>Evidence for EPF arises from embedded figures task (Witkin et al, 1971), as well as block design tasks (Shah &amp; Frith, 1983) in which children with ASD show superior performance to TD. In block design tasks, children with autism also show no further advantage to pre-segmented designs. This is due to perceptual processes being enhanced in ASD, which leads to locally orientateddetailed focused perception, compared to weak central coherence (WCC) which outlines a bias towards local elements (Charman et al, 2013). Thus, EPF highlights superiority in perceptual processing compared to processing style in WCC. Furthermore, IWA perform faster than TD children on conjunctive visual search tasks (Plaisted, O’Riordan &amp; Baron-Cohen, 1998) which further supports IWA have enhanced perceptual discrimination (Plaisted, O’Riordan &amp; Baron-Cohen, 1998) as EPF enables IWA to discriminate against colours and features resulting  in this faster processing. <nl>EPF can also explain savant skills, which are more common in ASD than the general population (Mottron et al, 2006), which highlights strengths of ASD. For example, exceptional drawing skills are due to EPF, as this encourages IWA to avoid perceptual closure, leading to more accurate and detailed focused drawings (Chamberlain et al, 2013). However, EPF doesn’t explain why this only occurs in some IWA, as there may be individual variations in processing perceptual information. <nl>EPF can also explain atypicality in sensory symptoms in IWA. Due to this enhanced perceptual processing, the threshold of detecting sensations is lowered (Lawson et al, 2015). However, Triomphe et al (2019) found IWA have atypical Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) modulation (linked to inhibition) which also explains tactile hypersensitivity in ASD. Therefore, EPF isn’t a sole explanation of why hypersensitivity occurs in IWA. Another limitation is EPF fails to explain why hyposensitivity occurs, and thus has weak explanatory power regarding sensory processing. <nl>Another low-level process in ASD is SM.  In electromyography responses in IWA, SM of emotional expressions is shown to be atypical (Beall et al, 2008) andor delayed (Oberman, Winkielman &amp; Ramachandran, 2009). SM is important for socio-emotional reciprocity, as Chartrand and Bargh (1999) found being mimicked makes people like us more. SM also underlies empathy (Drimalla et al, 2019). Therefore, this can explain impairments in developing relationships in ASD as well as a  lack of shared enjoyment displayed in ASD as IWA prefer to play on their own (Chevallier et al, 2012). <nl>The SMT explains deficits in social cognition related to lower-level processes.  Eye-tracking experiments by Klin et al (2002) found children with ASD look more at the background than characters in static social photographs. Furthermore, Vlamings et al (2010) found IWA have impairments in processing and identifying faces. According to EPF, this is due to enhanced processing of high spatial frequency information, an atypical process focusing on fine perceptual detail. However, the SMT states IWA  have less motivation to attend to faces as it is less rewarding, and this lack of experience can lead to poorer processing (Chevallier et al, 2012).<nl>Furthermore, Chamberlain, Rothman-Fuller and Kasari (2007) found children with ASD prefer isolated tasks compared to collaborative. Chevallier et al (2012) found this is due to selective social anhedonia (inability to feel social pleasure) in adolescents with ASD and this correlates with ASD severity. This explains impaired initiating and responding to in children with ASD in joint attention.   <nl>In conclusion, the above theories can contribute to atypical differences in ASD. EPF can explain atypical differences at a social and non-social level in ASD. SMT involves deficits in orienting to social information and behaviours which maintain social interaction (Chevallier et al, 2012), explaining social and communication impairments. Although, this cannot account for atypical restricted and repetitive behaviours (RRB) shown in IWA. In addition, despite SM being able to explain atypical social behaviours, it fails to explain communication and RRB. Failing to  account for a whole domain shown in IWA entirely shows serious limitations in using these theories for an explanatory power of the full ASD clinical profile. Furthermore, evidence given in support of these studies are task-dependent and artificial, such as eye-tracking and facial processing experiments as they do not reflect real-life settings. Likewise, lab studies lack validity and therefore may not be extrapolated. The above theories aren’t universal across all IWA as individual variations occur due to it being a spectrum disorder, as well as co-morbidity. Further research needs to be conducted on individual variations on atypical differences.<nl><nl><question4><nl>Apraxia of speech (AoS) is an acquired motor speech disorder (Ballard, Granier &amp; Robin, 2000). Phonological representation is intact and there is no difficulty in motor realization, but there is an impairment in converting representations into a motor plan; this results in but isn’t limited to; phonological and phonetic speech errors, distorted prosody and groping (visibleauditory attempts to find right position for articulators) (Galluzzi et al, 2015). There are many accounts regarding the cognitive difficulties underlying apraxia which I will compare and contrast.<nl>Firstly, there is an impairment in knowledge, specifically, a loss of knowledge of word-sized articulatory programmes. The hypothesis states there is damage to a direct word route which impairs retrieval for articulatory planning. Instead, speakers have to use a less efficient, laborious route. Varley and Whiteside (2001) state some apraxic speakers (AS) have lost the ability to access stored plans and thus assemble speech from smaller units, which causes dysfluency shown in AoS. Furthermore, Varley, Whiteside &amp; Luff (1999) found there were no frequency effects in word durations with 4 AS. However, results weren’t significant. Contrastingly, Aichert and Ziegler (2004) propose brain damage in apraxia causes a loss of lower frequency routes and perseverations of higher frequency ones. This is consistent with a similar notion AS have an impairment in knowledge of the spatio-temporal parameters associated with speech, such as word retrieval in speech production,  which has also led to imprecise motor planning (Shriberg, Aram &amp; Kwiatkowski, 1997). Ziegler &amp; Cramon (1986) support this as they found AS have difficulties in knowing which parameters to use or knowing timings of lowering the velum, which can cause phonetic errors.  <nl>The reduced buffer capacity hypothesis (RBCH) is another account of cognitive difficulties underlying apraxia (Rogers and Storkel, 1999). Firstly, a limitation in the articulatory output buffer which is involved in phoneme-articulatory conversion. The speech motor buffer can only fit one syllable at a time; this can account for syllabic segregation, false stops, and  pauses between syllablesconsonants in AS. This means AS can’t activate several speech motor programmes simultaneously (Galluzzi et al, 2015). Secondly, there is reduced efficiency of the articulatory planner as the process of phonological to auditory conversion has become slower andor less precise (Buchwald &amp; Miozzo 2012), similar to the hypothesis above. This accounts for slower speech shown in AS with impreciseness explaining phonetic errors produced. In addition, RBCH states speakers may simplify consonants as they are more difficult to produce e.g., CCV template to CV template  (Bernhardt &amp; Stemberger, 1998). Deger &amp; Ziegler (2002) support this as they found AS had longer reaction times (RT) when producing alternating syllables and use simplification to reduce complexity. This explains pauses between syllable and phonemes, and consonant elongations. Both studies however have small sample sizes and aren’t generalisable across all AoS speakers. <nl>The program retrieval deficit hypothesis (PRDH) however states cognitive difficulties in AoS is due to interference in accessing articulatory plans. There is competition amongst motor programmesplans for selection due to similarity, and this generates errors and dysfluency in AoS (Mailend et al, 2019). This is supported by Mailend &amp; Maas (2013) who found AS showed significantly longer RT to say a pre-specified word when distractors were presented. Moreover, Galluzzi et al (2015) found frequency effects may be due to errors of selection due to an intrusion of phonetic  competitors; this interference activates corresponding phonetic words. In another study Mailend et al (2019) contrasted RBCH with PRDH. AS in their study were expected to show longer RT when prime and target words were different compared to identical (switch-costs). They found the switch-cost was more significant compared to other groups, as predicted by the PRDH, not the RBCH. However, this may be  due to participants knowing the target prior, which could jumpstart activation or from interference from competitors activated by the prime. Deger &amp; Ziegler (2002) found AS took longer to initiate two different syllables ‘da-ba’ compared to identical syllable sequence (da-da), which RBCH cannot explain as the ‘da’ is loaded to the buffer first and identical. <nl>In conclusion, there are numerous accounts explaining cognitive difficulties in AoS. All accounts above can propose for groping and have similaritiescontrasts of their perspectives of why impairments occur in AS.  However, experimental tasks aforementioned are limited as results may differ ranging from the severity of impairments, as brain damage and addition of Aphasia in some speakers could yield different results. Therefore, there isn’t one account which can explain all cognitive difficulties of AoS as results for experiments are inconsistent. Further research into the different hypothesis’ can help tailor treatments for AS.\"", ",<nl>Just checking if you could do 11:10 tomorrow?

They offer a variety of transportation including; car-sharing and exotic car hiring. Enterprise Holdings is its parent company with over 100,000 branches worldwide, employing more than 100,000 people (Enterprise.co.uk, 2020). <nl><nl>Enterprise Holdings acquired City Car Club expanding to ‘Enterprise Car Club’ who hold a variety of fuel-efficient cars and vans rentable by the hour or day, through mobile devices for bookings, unlocking and returning using iOS and Android applications with tailored plans (Enterprise Holdings, 2020). <nl><nl>Membership entails fuel servicing, breakdown cover, insurance, cleaning, and MOTs. A vehicle is only paid for when required not otherwise. <nl><nl>This report will demonstrate a yearly period plan including different actions split over months to boost brand awareness amongst the student demographic at Aston University. <nl><nl>Segmentation, target market, differentiation and positioning <nl><nl>Segmentation is the process of dividing markets of potential customers into specific groups based on common characteristics, reducing the risk of an unsuccessful marketing campaign. The segmentation will investigate students on and off campus interested in vehicle usage whilst at university (TrackMaven | The Marketing Insights Company, 2020).<nl><nl>A target market is the group of individuals a business aims to sell its products and services to, where marketing messages can be crafted effectively once the market is established (Omicsonline.org, 2020). The target market is aimed towards the student demographic at Aston University on and off campus coming from different towns and backgrounds. It is innovative to allow students to drive flexibly instead of incurring the cost of a vehicle overall for commuting. The segment could become profitable through promotional activities and distribution channels after identifying the segment’s needs. (Marketing-Insider, 2020).<nl><nl>Differentiation of Enterprise Car club is offering a self-service car rental plan, tailored to students at cost-effective prices with virtual membership and option to rent by the hour or day, alongside a monthly membership option currently priced at £5.95 per hour and monthly prices at £6 per month subscription. This is more accessible to a younger demographic of students who typically use mobile technology frequently. Aston University students could see this as an opportunity to benefit by not spending significant amounts, especially with current rising costs of living. <nl><nl>Positioning refers to a business’s ability to influence perceptions of consumers concerning a brand or product. The main objective is to establish an identity of an offering, so customers perceive it positively (TrackMaven | The Marketing Insights Company, 2020). <nl><nl>Enterprise is a company that is going to be offering a cheap and available service to students alongside reducing carbon footprints(reference). This could attract segments of the demographic, who favour being conscious of the environment for the future. (reference)<nl><nl>Enterprise Rent A Cars’ already significant profile to allow consumers to feel safe with the company’s new service, proving the reliable position they already pose compared to competitors such as CO-wheels CarClub and SIXT. Students can be targeted through social media platforms and through campaigning on university campus similarly to UberEATS, by employing campaigners to increase awareness.<nl><figure><nl>A perceptual map is a tool used to differentiate competitors and highlight any gaps in the market. It shows our business as a high quality and low-price service, highlighting the potential for the brand to succeed and gain awareness amongst students. One of our main competitors is SIXT, discovered by constructing this perceptual map, we have established our advantage as we offer suitable age restrictions on the use of rentals as students will want to travel inside and outside of Birmingham more frequently. <nl><nl><figure><nl>Campaign objectives <nl>Specific is a clear, precise and directional objective put forward to understand what results are expected within the workforce, instead of the objective being generalised, causing confusion and poorer results (Lalama, 2015). An effective goal would be to increase sales by a certain percentage or increase the target on a weekly, monthly or yearly basis. <nl><nl>Our specific objectives are <nl>1)To attain 500 (or more) student buyers of the service before year-end at Aston University to reach our precise objective. <nl>2)To improve awareness of the Enterprise Car Club for the car rental service <nl><nl>Measurable measures a goal and is the stage where numbers come into fruition to keep track of progress. However, it can be difficult to understand if an objective has been reached. <nl><nl>Our measuring will be through:<nl><nl>1)Using surveys to measure student’s demand based on needs and wants, <nl>2)Identifying any potential niches. <nl><nl>This would allow the measurable objective of attaining 40-50 subscription members each month and link to the founding values of the company to honour consumers by listening to them.<nl><nl>Achievable goals are setting goals in a realistic period by taking small, planned steps towards a goal. <nl><nl>1)An example of a goal to be set is attaining data within each quarter of the year alongside aiming to increase brand awareness by 10%. Additionally, once achieved, the goal can progress to 20 new subscription members to achieve progression. <nl><nl>Overall this will contribute to the objective of reaching out to Aston University staff and students, with reasonable pricing that is visibly differentiated to competitors.<nl><nl>Realistic is forming goals based on the context of current economic, organisational and market conditions (Anon, 2020). <nl><nl>1)The current economic state will determine the likelihood of success when aiming to increase sales, as this would not be the best goal to set if the country is close to experiencing a recession period in their economic cycle.<nl><nl>2)Being the best low-cost provider is an example of a realistic goal for Enterprise CarClub profile competition, considering economic uncertainty in the UK because of Brexit. People may be less inclined to invest in vehicle ownership or maintenance because of the potential future inflation rate and currency value volatility.<nl><nl>3)Targeting 500 students as dealing with a small target market in the geographic location of Birmingham, this is a link to what we want to achieve and realistic. <nl><nl>Targeted &amp; Timed is using a specified deadline to reach a goal. If a time expiration does not exist, it will hinder efforts towards an achievement and evaluation.<nl><nl>1)Trying to achieve the specified number by the end of the year at Aston University, the target will be achieved through pushing collaborations through social media, helping target and appeal to the target market. <nl><nl>2)Customers will be more engaged with the services being offered, whilst measuring the effectiveness of this approach during and after and if results are proving unsatisfactory, measures can be taken to improve consumer satisfaction (Fill and Turnbull, 2016). <nl>Strategy and general rationale for specific tools <nl><nl>In the marketing strategy, there has been research on five stages, concerning our strategy. In initial thought, developing a strategic mission, vision and values allow Enterprise CarClub to set its standard to consumers and provide a positive image for their services. Setting objectives as stated in campaign objectives would be important to reach the vision, but meeting targets will only be possible if a strategy is tailored to the intended path. Executing the strategy would be the next step aided by prerequisites put in place, for example; a Gantt chart to work with, values to work towards goals and a mission to work on present communications to gain significant awareness. After executing the strategy, the focus is on analysing the external environment continuously, alongside the company’s internal situation to identify corrective adjustments (Gamble, Thompson and Peteraf, 2019).<nl>General rationale for specific tools selected:<nl><nl>In the marketing plan, looking further into advertising as a negotiated form of traditional and digital communication from an identifiable source can influence audiences. In the marketing plan, we are looking to follow a push strategy through Enterprise’s profile to attract the target market to buy subscriptions. It will allow Enterprise CarClub to reach the goal of building awareness with students, encourage and incentivise them to build a differentiated strategy in competition with others. A community of consumers can be built alongside the strategy by considering and monitoring brand image. (Richards and Curran, 2002).<nl><nl>Secondly, Sales Promotion is going to be used as it influences consumers in a way to buy a product (Fill and Turnbull, 2016). It is a tool that will influence student behaviour positively as incentives will be offered to trial the service initially and then decide to proceed if satisfied. A pull strategy will reel in consumers through discounts, bonuses, and coupons creating a feeling of need for the service. <nl><nl>Marketing Tool Plans- <nl>Advertising Tool<nl>Advertising is a strong form of communication that will enable Enterprise CarClub to reach their audience through engaging using a variety of resources, using the media category to carry advertising messages to allow for the use of billboards, magazines, digital newspapers and mobile and online advertising (Fill and Turnbull, 2016). <nl><figure><nl>Digital media has a strong level of interactivity in modern lives with social media being very prominent, for example, Instagram. Using this tool will provide Enterprise with a giant opportunity for advertisement (Fill and Turnbull, 2016). It is prefered to use this tool because of the benefits it will bring in terms of reaching a wider audience, especially with electronic word of mouth having a large impact and high level of users. Advertising holds the credibility to support marketing efforts such as; sales promotion, using methods to secure customers into the car rental subscriptions as consumers spend on what they believe will bring them reputable value. <nl><nl>Advertising holds the capability of effecting knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, behaviour of a target audience, persuading individuals to buy a product they have never purchased. It can suggest that advertising can increase sales using manipulative and psychological techniques with a large segment of passive consumers concerning the ‘Strong’ theory of advertising (Fill, 2009). <nl><nl>The (AIDA) model presents creating brand awareness of a product or service, the interest of the benefits of its uses to build sufficient foundation to encourage the buyer to research further, desire to go forward with an emotional connection through brand personality making consumers want it and action to make the buyer take the next step of engaging in making a phone call, signing up to a newsletter or engaging in a live chat for further information.<nl><nl>With awareness, a PR campaign can be running towards the student target market each month with different resources. Interest wise we could use surveys to gain student interest on campus to then offer further consultation after gaining the initial interest of what is important to their tailored service. Desire could lead to running local buzz campaigns to generate discounts due to the curiosity of a new service.

{"id": "3f067bee-a377-4aad-bd36-508b409daefd", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Police interviewing with eyewitnesses and victims has always been subject to scrutiny by psychologists and legal professionals. Over the past years, there has been significant psychological research in this area, with various new techniques being introduced and implemented in police training to ensure testimonies of eyewitnesses, victims, and suspects to be as accurate as possible. While these techniques can be applied to both eyewitnesses and suspects, victims of crime need particular care and consideration when being interviewed about the crime. One example of such victims are sexual assault victims. Studies have shown that only 16-20% of rape victims report the crime to the police or other legal justice systems (Kilpatrick et al.,1992). There are many reasons for such a low rate of reports; victims are likely to have PTSD (Karatas et al., 2020), they may be worried about confidentiality during interviews, both of which tie in with the belief that there’s a lack of training in police training when conducting interviews with sexual assault victims (Rich and Seffrin, 2012). This essay considers these factors and proposes two recommendations that the police should consider when interviewing sexual assault victims; 1) rapport building (Holmberg, 2004; Collins et al., 2002) and 2) the combination of the Cognitive Interview (Fisher and Geiselman, 1992) and an WRIP approach (Heydon and Powell, 2016).<nl><nl>A potential factor to consider when interviewing sexual assault victims is the method of  interviewing. A survey study has shown that among 429 police officers in the USA, many of them were not sufficiently skilled in conducting interviews with victims of sexual assault (Rich and Seffrin, 2012).  Such lack of training negatively impacts the volume of sexual assault reports the justice system receives. Therefore, it is important to implement a technique that addresses this issue of lack of training and in turn, encourages more victims to come forward and report sexual assault incidents. <nl>A key element of any police interview is rapport building. Rapport building is a type of effective communication skill (Vallano et al, 2015) that is characterised by establishing a positive and comfortable relationship and atmosphere between the interviewer and interviewee (Vallano and Campo, 2011). There are multiple ways in which a police interviewer can establish rapport with a sexual assault victim; addressing the victim by their name, active listening, adopting open body language (matching and mirroring the interviewee’s body language (Boe, 2009)), and maintaining frequent eye contact (St-Yves, 2006). Indeed, Holmberg (1994) (as cited in Holmberg, 2004) found that when rapport was used in an interview with a rape victim, the victim was more willing to narrate about the crime event as she claimed the interviewer encouraged her to describe the events in \"such an intimate way\" and felt he was doing it for \"her sake\" and not because it was \"for the investigation\". Moreover, Keats (1993) also found that when the technique of rapport-building was used in interviews, both the interviewer and interviewee were comfortable and appeared to freely discuss the events of the incident all while the interviewee demonstrated willingness to co-operate with the investigation.<nl><nl>Another advantage of rapport building is that it seems to elicit more correctly recalled information and more detailed information (Pinizzotto &amp; Davis, 1996; Collins et al., 2002). Therefore, not only does this technique increase willingness in victims to come forward and report sexual assault crimes, but it also increases the quality and quantity of information recalled by interviewees, an aspect that has always been a drawback of investigative interviewing.<nl>However, as with any recommendation, there are a few limitations to consider. While the notion of rapport-building is commonly known in the legal justice system and highly recommended by researchers and practitioners (Abbe and Brandon, 2013), it is important to note that the definition of rapport-building is not clear-cut, that is, much of the literature surrounding this technique includes a variety of definitions. While some researchers claim rapport-building involves creating a positive and friendly relationship with the interviewee (Collins et al., 2002; Hartwig et al., 2005; Vallano and Compo, 2011), others argue that it is defined as a neutral, working relationship between the two parties (Abbe and Brandon, 2013). With such conflicting definitions, it is hard for police interviewers to gauge a comprehensive understanding of rapport-building and hence may result in them not using the technique to its full potential.<nl>Nevertheless, a questionnaire study conducted on 221 police interviewers in the UK revealed that police officers reported using rapport 87% of the time during their investigations with witnesses (Dando et al., 2008). This suggests that despite the contradicting definitions of rapport-building, police officers are still seeing the value in the technique and as a result, are implementing it in their interviews. Therefore, rapport-building is a valuable and effective technique that should be administered during interviews with sexual assault victims.<nl><nl>Another key reason as to why many sexual assault victims do not come forward and seek help from the legal justice system is because many of them experience PTSD. Around two thirds of women were reported to have features of PTSD (Karatas et al., 2020). This may lead to victims being scared to come forward as they believe that the police would not be trained to efficiently deal with their trauma and fail to understand them. <nl>An example of police interviewing technique that the police are required to use in their investigative interviews is the Cognitive Interview (Fisher and Geiselman, 1992). As well as the 4 main stages of the interview – mental reinstatement of context, reporting from a different perspective, reverse order reporting and in-depth reporting – the interview, more importantly, involves an introduction and a ‘transfer control’ phase (Geiselman and Fisher, 2014). During the introduction, the interviewer asks the interviewee simple questions, attempting to build rapport. In the ‘transfer control’ phase, the interviewer informs the interviewee that they are the expert since they were at the scene themselves. These two steps are crucial in that they enable the interviewee to have a more favourable experience of the interview (Fisher and Geiselman, 2010), meaning their satisfaction levels of police services are likely to increase. These satisfaction levels, in turn, are linked to reduced levels of PTSD type symptoms (Kunst et al., 2013) in interviewees who have experienced traumatising events, such as sexual assault. <nl><nl>While the Cognitive Interview has many benefits and has been found to improve total and correct recall more so than the standard interview (Gwyer and Clifford, 1997), there are problems with its practical application. One problem is that police officers believe the interview is very time consuming and takes longer to conduct than a standard interview and thus, cannot conduct the full interview (Kebbell et al., 1999). Another issue is that it requires significant levels of concentration and cognitive demands on the police interviewer (Fisher and Geiselman, 1992; Kebbell et al, 1999). <nl>Therefore, with these limitations in mind, Heydon and Powell (2016) propose a possible technique that could be introduced to police interview training, as an addition to the traditional interviewing techniques, known as written-response interview protocol (WRIP). This approach involves anonymous and confidential written reporting options for sexual assault victims commonly before a traditional interview. An example of a WRIP approach could be that victims of sexual assault write their story in their own time – whenever they feel ready – with prompts and guidelines designed to focus their writing on key points as well as maximise their recall. This written format can then be followed up with a formal interview. In terms of anonymous reporting, a WRIP that aims to achieve this should include instructions that are consistent with the Cognitive Interview techniques. For instance, a WRIP for confidential reporting must begin with an ‘Engage and Explain’ phase that includes the Cognitive Interview’s ‘report everything’ phase. While still remaining anonymous, it is important to still engage with the interviewee, to show sensitivity to them. Thus, it is evident that this approach allows police interviewers to have a lot of flexibility when interviewing sexual assault victims. <nl><nl>With the WRIP approach, many of the Cognitive Interview limitations are addressed. By allowing victims to record their experiences themselves as soon as possible after the crime, the police interviewers can use those initial reports for reference during the face-to-face interview phase, reducing the cognitive demands imposed on them by the interview technique and reducing the time it takes to conduct a full interview. Furthermore, by incorporating these two techniques together, the victims’ satisfaction levels, rapport building, and the quality of their testimonies are not compromised, rather they are further encouraged. However, it is vital to note that there has been no further research on the combination of these two techniques and their validity in real life situations. Nevertheless, theoretically, this collaboration appears to be the ‘Golden Standard’ and ‘fool-proof’ in the context of investigative interviewing. Therefore, with such considerations in mind, the combinations of these techniques should be considered as a practice for gathering evidence from sexual assault victims.<nl><nl>In conclusion, interviewing sexual assault victims is tricky. Regardless of age, gender, size, etc. reflecting and talking about such traumatic events is not easy for any individual. It is possible that it is because of this sensitivity of the topic that many victims are reluctant to come forward and report the crimes done to them. Nevertheless, it is the legal justice system’s responsibility that they have such measures in place that allow the victims to feel even a little bit of comfort when coming forward. It is the police’s responsibility to ensure the victims feel as if they made the right choice by reporting the crime. Considering some of the factors that might prevent victims from coming forward, this essay proposes two main recommendations that the police could potentially introduce in their practice. Both of these recommendations have a key thing in common – building rapport. Thus, it can be concluded that in any type of investigative interviewing, building rapport is the most important aspect.", "<nl><nl> <nl><nl>I received an invitation to collaborate on the <organisation> videos but when I click 'accept invite' it says I have invalid credentials and does not let me access the folder.<nl><nl> <nl><nl>Best Regards,<nl><nl> <nl><nl><part_FN><new>YOURE WELCOMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<nl><nl><part_FN_SN><nl><nl>3rd Year Placement <course> Student<nl><nl><university><new>Hi <addr1_FN>,<nl><nl> <nl><nl>Hope you had a great Christmas and happy new year! <nl><nl> <nl><nl>I am currently working on the methods section of my dissertation and while I was conducting a final literature search, I came across a few studies that looked at <topic1> instead of <topic2>.

{"id": "0fdcdfc5-bd22-44fe-b3bc-c1134ec13f4b", "discourse_types": ["essay", "memo"], "pair": ["<question1><nl>The Monty Hall Dilemma (MHD) was a game transformed to puzzle format by Nalebuff (1987) and the aim is to choose the door with the grand prize behind it. Aside from the grand prize, the two other doors hold small gifts, a ‘lesser gift’ door is revealed, and contestants are asked whether they would like to switch their original door choice. <nl>The correct solution, given by Marilyn Voss, is that one should always switch. The contestant's original decision has a 13 chance of holding the grand prize, and once a door with the smaller gift is disclosed, that door has a 03 chance of holding the prize, meaning that the last door now has a 23 chance of holding the grand prize. Switching increases the chances of the contestant winning, but the problem is that when given the choice, most of them do not switch.<nl><nl>Granberg and Brown (1995) found that less than 15% of participants switched during lab replications. One reason for this may be that when asked how they would feel hypothetically, participants said they would feel worse if they lost after switching compared to losing with their original choice. Gilovich et al. (1995) found and concluded in a similar study that participants who switched experienced greater pain from their decision and explained the idea that ‘regrettable actions pack a bigger punch than inactions’. <nl>A supporting idea is given by Petrocelli &amp; Harris (2011) as they found that individuals tend to have increased levels of counterfactual thinking when they switch to a grand prize and lose. They argue that this reduces the ability to learn the solution of the problem and that counterfactual thinking influences memory distortions which has an effect on future decisions.<nl><nl>Another reason people may choose to stay rather than switch in dilemmas such as the MHD is the idea of an ‘illusion of control’ (Langer, 1975). Granberg and Dorr (1998) found that switching increased when a different person made the final decision. In this instance, it appeared as if individuals who made the decision stay or switch after an initial person, felt less obligated to stay. The authors suggest that the individuals who make the first decision believe that they must stick to the decision they made - without any grounds. However they did find that this wasn’t something that affected individuals long-term, as they averaged out to the same switch rate as a control group. <nl><nl>Even though it seems the majority stick, there are instances where people choose to switch. As mentioned before, rates of switching increase when there are manipulated factors. Friedman (1998) conducted a study where participants received $0.40 for the grand prize and $0.10 for the lesser for 10 rounds. He found the switching rate increased from 10-30% by the end of the rounds, suggesting that participants were learning to make the right decision. More interestingly, in the second half of his experiment he placed participants into one of four groups (larger incentives, record-keepers, a conflicting advice group and a compare group that were told around 60% of participants who switch win). Friedman found in each condition that there were increasing numbers of those that switched - up to more than half, but no one condition reaching 100.<nl>This presents the idea that people can do better in environments when given opportunities to understand the game. So, this could be the reason underpinning why some choose to switch, the fact that they can learn and understand how to play the game. Monetary incentives may also have a role in encouraging participants to learn at a faster rate. <nl><nl>A systematic review by Saenen et al. (2018) found that there were a few reasons why people sometimes decided to switch, including superior math skills, working memory and inhibition ability. However, they argued only behavioural performance improved and that there’s no hard evidence that individuals gained understanding of the problem. They also mention that behavioural performance isn’t consistent and that it’d be difficult to obtain consistent results, just by manipulating one factor that influences individuals to make the decision to stay.<nl><nl>The correct solution to win in the MHD is to switch and research has attempted to show that participants are more likely to switch when they are in situations where they are able to learn the rules of such games. However, switching is something a majority of people fail to do at first glance due to many reasons, including illusions of control or the value they put on their feelings after deciding. <nl><nl><question2><nl>Moral Reasoning (MR) is the process of using logic to determine whether an action or decision is right or wrong. Utilitarianism and Deontology, established from Bentham (1748-1833) and Kant (1724-1804), are forms of MR and are associated with systems for decision-making.<nl><nl>Deontological forms of MR argue that the right thing to do depends on actions’ intrinsic value, e.g. the act of lying is bad. Holyoak and Powell (2016) discuss deontology and say that it acknowledges individuals’ unique positions in situations. They mention a number of factors that occur within deontological ethics such as, doing versus allowing (actively harming versus allowing harm), intentions (being judged for an action’s intentions) and preferential treatment for important relationships. <nl>In terms of systems, deontology associates with system 1 response characteristics, which refers to fast and primitive evolutionary thinking.<nl><nl>Utilitarian forms of MR are seen as consequential and the theory argues that the right act is the one that maximises the greatest utility for the group of individuals. Holyoak and Powell address that utilitarianism is linked to the idea of economic utility and cost-benefit analyses. This differs from deontology as it focuses solely on the best consequences which are seemingly the total wellbeing of the involved individuals.<nl>Utilitarianism is perceived as a system 2 response, which is analytical and uses new evolutionary tactics. Supportive evidence for two systems in MR was given by Greene et al. (2001). They found that in instances of the personal and impersonal versions of the trolley dilemma (deciding whether to push a lever to save the 5 lives or deciding to push a large individual), individuals who made ‘utilitarian responses’ (to push) took longer to think, and brain imaging revealed that brain regions more closely related to working memory were active, compared to those who made deontological responses – who showed more activity in brain regions related to emotions. Differences in neural activity support the idea that there are possibly two different systems used in moral decision-making.<nl><nl>So far, utilitarian &amp; deontological forms of MR appear very different (actions versus consequences), even via neural structures. However, critics suggest that deontological reasoning is another form of utility. Cohen and Ahn (2016) argue for a single process model rather the dual systems. They asked participants to rate items and people (to display differences in individual utility) and once incorporated into the trolley dilemma, they found correlations with the reaction times &amp; probabilities of making a deontological decision and how similar items’ utility value were. This could suggest that deontological decision-making may just be what the decision-maker holds valuable to them.<nl>A similar idea of this lack of distinction was proposed by Ditto and Liu (2011) who argued that those who make deontological responses use consequentialism. They asked people how many individuals would need to be saved in order for them to push another individual and found that participants who gave the deontological response spoke about higher likelihoods of the individuals escaping the train track and low possibilities that pushing the man would stop the trolley. This suggests that even when they make their decision, they’re using consequentialism, suggesting the theories aren’t separate.<nl><nl>More criticism is proposed on whether the distinction between the two theories is valid or whether it’s a misconception, as Gray and Schein (2012) argue that morality is defined by the combination of two minds (moral agents- the actors, and moral patients- the sufferers), As a combination, they argue that neither deontology nor utilitarianism can account for MR on their own. Because of this, they also bring up the idea that paradigms that set utilitarian and deontological reasoning against each other provides false concepts of MR. <nl>Likewise, Kahane (2015) discredits the use of sacrificial dilemmas- which much research on MR is founded on - to assess the difference between any forms of MR. One reasons he gives refers to the idea that in some dilemmas, the option to sacrifice puts the individual in a position where the decision could be made out of self-interest. <nl><nl>Deontological forms of MR appear to be about an agent’s intentionality whereas utilitarianism refers more to consequences. There is conflicting consensus about whether they’re two different systems but there's criticism about the fact that as theories, they aren’t necessarily distinctive, more importantly, the use of dilemmas to assess the forms of MR are not beneficial and do not account for MR in the real world. Dilemmas like this are also snapshot instances and its very questionable as to whether these theories can describe MR outside said dilemmas.<nl><nl>", "Hi CEO, As requested, I have been able to find the itinerary items for your trip to Finland.

{"id": "e291bf9c-8d31-44ad-b9a3-00bb7ca88de6", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Abstract<nl>Previous research has suggested that incongruent stimuli delays reaction times than congruent stimuli. In this study, participants were presented with words of colours and were asked to respond to the font colour. The words either matched their font colour (congruent) or were dissimilar to their font colour (incongruent). Their reaction time was measured in milliseconds (ms) across 60 trials and comparisons were drawn between the two conditions. The mean reaction time was 878.8ms for the congruent condition and 966.8ms for incongruent. This difference is significant.<nl><nl>Introduction<nl>When performing the classic Stroop task, participants were asked to identify the colour of a printed word and ignore its meaning (Entel &amp; Tzelgov, 2018). The Stroop effect occurs when the written word (\"blue\") is printed in a non-matching font colour (red) which delays reaction time. The stimuli (words) are incongruent and reaction time is affected by the automatic cognitive process of reading words. (Stroop, 1935; Braisby &amp; Gellatly, 2012; Grondin, 2016). <nl>Previous research has suggested that incongruent stimuli delays reaction times than congruent stimuli. There is literature that suggests that this is a consistent effect. <nl>Stroop (1935) compared the difference in time for reading words printed in black and coloured ink (2.3 seconds) then the difference in naming colours of the squares and font colour (47.0 seconds). <nl><figure><nl><nl>Results from Stroop (1935) showed that reaction times slowed, by an average 110.3 seconds (Goodwin, 2010), when the font colour was different from the meaning of the word (for example, when ‘red’ was written in yellow ink) in comparison to naming the word in colour (43.3 seconds) - 67 seconds difference.<nl><figure><nl>Other studies have also shown this effect such as Datta, Nebhinani &amp; Dixit (2019). Datta et al. (2019) compared the difference in reaction times in three conditions (neutral, congruent and incongruent). The incongruent condition (condition 3), had participants reacting to both Hindi and English versions of the Stroop task where the words were written in both English and Hindi. The incongruent condition meant the name of the colour-word did not match with the font colour (Datta et al., 2019). The study had 42 participants and each condition of each language had 48 trials.<nl>Results from Datta et al. (2019) showed a mean of 1051.93 milliseconds (ms) in the English version incongruent condition which was 54.8 ms slower than the Hindi version in condition 3 (997.13 ms) and 151.63 ms slower when comparing to the English version in Condition 2 (900.30 ms).<nl>These researchers found that incongruent trials took longer to respond to than congruent trials, therefore the prediction for this study was that students would take longer to react to stimuli in the incongruent condition than reacting to stimuli in the congruent condition.<nl><nl>Method<nl>Design<nl>The experiment used a repeated measures design. The independent variable was congruency with two levels - incongruent and congruent. The dependent variable was reaction time measured in milliseconds.<nl><nl>Participants<nl>Overall, there were 59 participants. All were Psychology Undergraduate students from Aston University and a volunteer sample, recruited through University comms.<nl><nl>Apparatus and Materials<nl>Participants used personal computers to complete the experiment. This study used PsychoPy to collect data – an experimental software which recorded participants reaction time. <nl>The words used were ‘Red’, ‘Green’, and ‘Blue’ (See Figure. 3, Figure. 4 and Figure. 5). The font used was Arial, with the stimuli positioned in the centre of the screen at (0,0). The response options were keyboard arrow keys, left for ‘red’ ink, up for ‘green’ and right for ‘blue’. There were 10 reps to each 6 stimulus types, totalling 60 trials in blocks of 10.<nl><figure><nl>Procedure<nl>Participants gave consent to participate in the study and took part in the experiment individually.<nl>At the beginning of the experiment, participants received written instructions on their monitor. Participants read the instructions in their own time before pressing an arrow on the keyboard to begin the experiment. The instructions described what the participants were to do and which keys they would need to use to respond to the stimuli. (See Appendix 1 for full instructions.).<nl>The stimuli were presented on the computer in a random sequence, the words appearing singularly, on the monitor, centre-screen, and only disappearing when participants pressed an accepted key. The experiment ended when all 60 trials were completed.<nl><nl>Results <nl><table><nl>Table 1 shows that mean reaction times were longer in the colour incongruent than colour congruent condition. Both SDs are high relative to the mean, this suggests the data may not be reliable as there are large within condition differences. However, a Wilcoxon signed ranks test showed that this difference was highly statistically significant (T = 403.0 , N = 59, p&lt;.001).<nl><nl>Discussion<nl>Conclusion<nl>The results are consistent with the hypothesis of this study and previous research, as participants took longer to react to stimuli in the incongruent condition than the congruent condition – statistically significant. This suggests that reaction time was affected by the automatic cognitive process of reading words when attempting to react to the colour (Stroop, 1935; Braisby et al. 2012; Grondin, 2016; MacLeod, 1991). Cohen, Dunbar &amp; McClelland (1990) would suggest that this also illustrates the way people process information and people’s capacity for selective attention.<nl><nl>Methodological Issues<nl>Due to the way the experiment was ran, participants completed the study not in a standardised environment, completing the study on the different computers or PCs in dissimilar environments. If this study were repeated, participants would use a standard University computer. Also, to verify the demographics of the participants to confirm the ratio of gender and age, as studies has found gender and age differences to response with the Stroop task.  (\"What the Stroop Effect Reveals About Our Minds | Lesley University\", 2020).<nl><nl>Further Research<nl>Further research could include changing the stimulus to test its effects on reaction time. For example, changing the word to be a synonym of the colour (changing red to crimson) or becoming an anagram (red to rde) - like Hintzman et al. (1972); Regan (1978).<nl>Alternatively, changing the colour to a random word (red to ‘ask’, ‘monkey’, ‘heart’, ‘blood’.) (Crannell &amp; Parrish, 1957; \"Stroop effect\", 2020; Posner &amp; Snyder, 1975).", "<addr8_FN>,<nl> <nl>My full name is <part_FN_MN_SN>, and my date of birth is &lt;DDMMYYYY&gt;<nl> <nl>Kind regards,<nl> <nl><part_FN_SN><new>Hi <addr3_FN>,<nl><nl>I hope you had a nice weekend, I wanted to give you an update on my current situation.

{"id": "a5ee6445-64f2-439b-93bf-c3acf564a724", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Thank you for visiting. <nl><nl>Will you be able to bring a wrongful dismissal claim against Wildlife Wonders?<nl>To legally bring a Wrongful Dismissal Claim (WDC), the employer must have unjustifiably breached fundamental contractual clauses, resulting in the employee’s consequential loss. Applying this, did Wildlife Wonders (WW) breach a term in your contract, causing you consequential loss? You are likely to be successful arguing WW breached your implied term of mutual trust and confidence, as Narinder disrespected you in front of your colleagues and did not keep your performance issues confidential. Managers are obliged to ensure workplaces offer senses of belongingness and motivation, but this was not your experience. <nl><nl>You can argue breach of Job clause, because Narinder asked you to perform duties outside your contract which were unreasonable, given you are a cameraman and not a speaker. Narinder transferred you to Accounting, which is not the job responsibilities expected from a cameraman. This may give rise to a breach in your renumeration clause, because your accounting transfer, may have increased your salary and should be paid accordingly. Your resulting consequential loss resulting is your resignation and lack of work.<nl><nl>Eligibility to bring WDC, requires the claimant to be an employee. Applying the legal test of an employee, did you wear uniform whilst working? Were you integrated and controlled by WW employees? As your manager, Narinder assigned you projects. You used a company car. This validates you were sufficiently integrated and controlled within WW, deeming you an employee. <nl><nl>The law requires the claimant must be dismissed by their employer, under misconduct. WW did not dismiss you, but you resigned. The law recognises resignations as constructive dismissal, providing it has been done at a reasonable time, justified through contractual breaches and is evidenced in writing. You telephoned Narinder your resignation notice, giving reasons. This does not take imminent, legal effect because you must provide your resignation in writing. I advise you email Narinder your resignation notice, for this will reach Narinder faster. Following this, you will be eligible to bring WDC against WW. <nl><nl>Can you bring an Unfair Dismissal Claim against Wildlife Wonders?<nl>To bring an Unfair Dismissal Claim (UDC), the law requires the employer to defend the claimant’s claim. You are likely to succeed with UDC against WW, so I shall focus on this. <nl><nl>To be lawfully eligible, the claimant must be an employee. Following my explanation in WDC section, you satisfy this. Law places two additional requirements. Firstly, the claimant must not be excluded from claiming due to their occupation. A cameraman is very unlikely to be excluded and you have not signed a compromising agreement with WW. Secondly, the claimant must have worked for their employee for a continuous period of two years. you have worked for WW for ten years, allowing you eligibility to bring UDC.  <nl><nl>Procedural requirements<nl>Regarding time limits, the law established a 3 months minus one day from effective date of termination, deadline for WDC submitted to tribunals. WDC submitted to court have 6 year deadline.  If you resigned on 28th November 2020, you have until 27th February 2021 to submit your WDC to a tribunal. You will have until 27th November 2026 to submit your WDC to court. As you want to bring a WDC and UDC, you are advised to bring both claims to a tribunal. As your salary is £52,000, any award exceeding £25,000 will be taxed and presented in court. Bringing both claims, means your legal fees is likely to be subtracted from your compensation, allowing you to bring your claims to a tribunal.  <nl><nl>I advise you submit your WDC to the tribunal as soon as possible, I am happy to assist you with this. The tribunal requires you to attend Early Conciliation meeting to settle your dispute. ACAS is an independent statutory body, aiming to provide early conciliations. You will receive a certificate number which must be presented to the tribunal as evidence of attempted conciliation. If the dispute is not resolved with WW, the tribunal will give you an additional month to submit your WDC to them. You will have until 27 March 2021 to submit WDC. You still remain an employee of WW, as you have not evidenced your resignation in writing and have not been dismissed.<nl><nl>Like WDC, the law requires the claimant to have been dismissed by their employer. You must prove you have been dismissed from WW, namely confirming your resignation in writing. Like WDC, in UDC you must attend ACAS hearing, in an attempt to settle your dispute.  <nl><nl>If you choose to formally resign and have attended ACAS hearing, you must attach the certificate number onto the ET1 Tribunal Claim Form. I am happy to assist in completing this. This will be sent to WW, who will have 28 days to respond to your claim through the ET3 Tribunal Claim Form. <nl><nl>What would be the prospects of you succeeding with each claim?<nl>You have the burden to prove your WDC and UDC. As I stated, you are likely to successfully justify both claims. Once WW have received your ET1 Form, the burden will be on them to defend your claim. They must justify their actions as being reasonable, supporting your employment contract. Narinder will attempt to argue she was reasonable in sending you to different countries for projects,  as your job is to film nature. However, Narinder was unreasonable in being disrespectful to you. Given Narinder’s lack of knowledge and your strong reputation, Narinder should have understood you. <nl><nl>Narinder has not justified her reasons for transferring you to accounting, knowing it is outside your contract and you dislike it. This represents an unjustifiable breach in your job clause, as you were not contracted to deliver talks and work in accountancy but contracted to film creatures. Narinder is unlikely to successfully justify her disrespectful comments to you. Also, you did not consent to your performance issues (should remain confidential) being publicised. <nl><nl>WDC Prospect<nl>It is unlikely WW will succeed in defending your claim, unless it amounts to gross misconduct, or WW reverse their decision of you working in Accounting department and allow you to resume working as a cameraman. <nl><nl>A tribunal will lawfully consider gross misconduct, as evidence of the employee breaching their contract, so bad that it damages the relationship between the employer and employee. This would allow the employer to dismiss the employee, without worrying about potential WDC against them, as the employee’s breach has invalidated their contract and rights to notice. Here, WW best way of proving gross misconduct is through your poor performance in the last two-three years. The tribunal however, are more likely to consider this to be minor misconduct or serious misconduct. They will consider that your poor performance was due to WW breaching your job clause by assigning you duties which were outside of your contract and profession. The tribunal will also consider your strong reputation. <nl><nl>WW may be able to defend your WDC by reversing their decision of you working in accounting and allow you to resume working as a cameraman. You will only be successful in arguing breaches in your contract, if WW did not allow you to work your notice period or they paid you less than the value of your entitled benefits, namely your pension, paid leave, discretionary Christmas bonus and use of Land Rover.<nl><nl>In law, your minimum notice period is implied into your employment contract. The higher notice period indicated in your contract or legislation will prevail. Your contract entitles you to eight weeks’ notice, but law states you are entitled to ten weeks’ notice; as you have worked with WW for ten years. Therefore WW must pay you ten weeks’ worth salary notice, plus monetary value of benefits you would have been entitled to during your notice period. <nl><nl>However, if you choose to evidence your resignation in writing, your resignation will be legal meaning your right to work your notice period will be lost. However WW are legally obliged to fulfil your payment in lieu clause, by paying you monetary value for your company benefits such as paid leave, Christmas bonus, use of Land Rover and Pension scheme. <nl><nl>UDC Prospect <nl>It is unlikely WW will be able to defend your claim, unless they satisfy the tribunal’s requirements arguing they were fair and reasonable in dismissing you for one or more of the five reasons established in law and in doing so, they followed a fair dismissal procedure. Here the burden will be on WW to prove this and must also justify your resignation. If WW are unable to defend your resignation reasons (which I think is likely), you will succeed in arguing WW constructively dismissed you. <nl><nl>Applying this, WW may use ‘other substantial reason,’ ground to defend your dismissal; namely they incurred losses from your projects. Another fair reason WW may use to defend your dismissal may be ‘misconduct,’ regarding your work performance. This is unlikely to succeed, as WW would be required to follow ACAS Disciplinary Guidelines, such as opting for Mediation with you, before dismissing you. As with WDC, the tribunal would require evidence of your work performance from the last two-three years.<nl><nl>Whether you was dismissed withwithout notice, WW must prove they dismissed you following a fair and reasonable dismissal procedure. Here, after orally resigning you have not met with Narinder to further discuss your decision. As the employer, WW should have done this to ensure your dismissal was fair but because they did not, you are likely to be successful in arguing your UDC; as silence from your resignation was a negative response. <nl><nl>What are your options, and what would be the advantages and disadvantages of pursuing each option?<nl>Please find below a list of options available to you. <nl><nl>Option 1: Do not resign and tolerate Narinder’s behaviour.<nl><nl>Advantages:<nl>• You continue to have a regular job and income.<nl>• No stress about finding alternative work.<nl>• Saves time and money, as you will not spend thousands on your legal bill. <nl><nl>Disadvantage:<nl>• Narinder’s disrespectful behaviour may not change.<nl>• The reasonable time for you to resign and argue constructive dismissal from WW will pass. <nl><nl>Option 2: Do not resign, but seek an amicable solution to address Narinder’s behaviour. <nl><nl>Advantages: <nl>• Same as Option 1. <nl>• WW may appreciate your feedback, leading to improvements in Narinder’s behaviour. <nl>• WW may assign you a new line manager. <nl><nl>Disadvantage:<nl>• Same for Option 1, but hopefully this will not happen. <nl><nl>Option 3: Do not resign, but raise a grievance case against Narinder. <nl><nl>Advantages:<nl>• Same as option 2, however WW may consider this to be a drastic measure to take. <nl><nl>Disadvantage:<nl>• Same as Options 1-2. <nl><nl>Option 4: Hand in your notice but do not claim. <nl><nl>Advantages:<nl>• You will be free from Narinder’s treatment. <nl>• You will save time and money in bringing a claim against them.<nl>• You will receive all benefits you are entitled to during your notice period. <nl><nl>Disadvantages:<nl>• You will be unemployed after your notice period.<nl>• Stressful finding another job. <nl><nl>Option 5: Resign and argue constructive dismissal under WDC and UDC.<nl><nl>Advantages:<nl>• You will receive your entitled benefits had you worked your notice period. <nl>• You will feel happy seeing Narinder being disciplined for her behaviour.<nl>• Feel happy seeing WW negative publicity.<nl><nl>Disadvantages:<nl>• Same as Option 4.<nl>• There is no guarantee of winning which may waste your time and money. <nl><nl>I think Option 2 is beneficial to you, however it is your choice. <nl><nl>What remedies might you seek, and, if they include financial compensation, how much -providing figures where possible - is a court or tribunal likely to order Wildlife Wonders to pay out to you, should you succeed with each claim?<nl><nl>WDC<nl>The tribunal may award you financial compensation, an injunction andor declaration that WW wrongfully dismissed you. The tribunal is likely to award you compensation, as this suits your needs better because a declaration will financially damage WW more due to negative publicity. <nl><nl>Your compensation will be depend on if WW allow you to work your notice period or they pay you the monetary value of your entitled benefits instead. The tribunal will order WW to pay you 10 weeks’ worth salary (£10,000), as this is your legal notice period entitlement. This will include your benefits entitlements, namely your pension of approximately £4,000. Your notice will continue throughout the Christmas period, hence the tribunal will order WW to pay you your contractual Christmas Bonus (£1,560). As this is discretionary, the tribunal will order this, if you receive your ‘Christmas [bonus]’ regularly. If so, WW must pay your bonus, as this constitutes an employee contractual ‘right[s] to receive.’ <nl><nl>Currently, you have taken two days’ leave. I doubt you would taken more, during your notice. Legally, employers must compensate employees for untaken leave, because employers have benefitted from extra employee work. Therefore, the tribunal will award you 26 days’ worth salary (£3,703.96). To avoid this, WW may encourage you to take leave during your notice. <nl><nl>Your compensation totals £19,263.96. This includes notice salary (£10,000), Pension (£4,000), untaken leave (£3,703.96) and Christmas bonus (£1,560). Without Christmas bonus your compensation totals £17,703.96. Your desire to keep Land Rover may reduce your compensation. Subtracting the car, your compensation totals £11,763.96 or £10,203.96 without Christmas bonus. When negotiating with WW do not make it obvious you wish to keep the car. Given your strong reputation and to avoid publicity, WW may allow you to keep the car. If your accounting transfer increased your salary, the tribunal will order WW to pay the difference. Your overall compensation is below tribunal’s maximum award of £25,000. I advise you bring your WDC and UDC to a tribunal. <nl><nl>UDC<nl>The tribunal can lawfully re-instate you into your current job, with Narinder continuing as your manager.

{"id": "91cb6a6e-0f45-4c14-818a-75a068523e29", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["<question1><nl>The Monty Hall Dilemma (MHD) was a game transformed to puzzle format by Nalebuff (1987) and the aim is to choose the door with the grand prize behind it. Aside from the grand prize, the two other doors hold small gifts, a ‘lesser gift’ door is revealed, and contestants are asked whether they would like to switch their original door choice. <nl>The correct solution, given by Marilyn Voss, is that one should always switch. The contestant's original decision has a 13 chance of holding the grand prize, and once a door with the smaller gift is disclosed, that door has a 03 chance of holding the prize, meaning that the last door now has a 23 chance of holding the grand prize. Switching increases the chances of the contestant winning, but the problem is that when given the choice, most of them do not switch.<nl><nl>Granberg and Brown (1995) found that less than 15% of participants switched during lab replications. One reason for this may be that when asked how they would feel hypothetically, participants said they would feel worse if they lost after switching compared to losing with their original choice. Gilovich et al. (1995) found and concluded in a similar study that participants who switched experienced greater pain from their decision and explained the idea that ‘regrettable actions pack a bigger punch than inactions’. <nl>A supporting idea is given by Petrocelli &amp; Harris (2011) as they found that individuals tend to have increased levels of counterfactual thinking when they switch to a grand prize and lose. They argue that this reduces the ability to learn the solution of the problem and that counterfactual thinking influences memory distortions which has an effect on future decisions.<nl><nl>Another reason people may choose to stay rather than switch in dilemmas such as the MHD is the idea of an ‘illusion of control’ (Langer, 1975). Granberg and Dorr (1998) found that switching increased when a different person made the final decision. In this instance, it appeared as if individuals who made the decision stay or switch after an initial person, felt less obligated to stay. The authors suggest that the individuals who make the first decision believe that they must stick to the decision they made - without any grounds. However they did find that this wasn’t something that affected individuals long-term, as they averaged out to the same switch rate as a control group. <nl><nl>Even though it seems the majority stick, there are instances where people choose to switch. As mentioned before, rates of switching increase when there are manipulated factors. Friedman (1998) conducted a study where participants received $0.40 for the grand prize and $0.10 for the lesser for 10 rounds. He found the switching rate increased from 10-30% by the end of the rounds, suggesting that participants were learning to make the right decision. More interestingly, in the second half of his experiment he placed participants into one of four groups (larger incentives, record-keepers, a conflicting advice group and a compare group that were told around 60% of participants who switch win). Friedman found in each condition that there were increasing numbers of those that switched - up to more than half, but no one condition reaching 100.<nl>This presents the idea that people can do better in environments when given opportunities to understand the game. So, this could be the reason underpinning why some choose to switch, the fact that they can learn and understand how to play the game. Monetary incentives may also have a role in encouraging participants to learn at a faster rate. <nl><nl>A systematic review by Saenen et al. (2018) found that there were a few reasons why people sometimes decided to switch, including superior math skills, working memory and inhibition ability. However, they argued only behavioural performance improved and that there’s no hard evidence that individuals gained understanding of the problem. They also mention that behavioural performance isn’t consistent and that it’d be difficult to obtain consistent results, just by manipulating one factor that influences individuals to make the decision to stay.<nl><nl>The correct solution to win in the MHD is to switch and research has attempted to show that participants are more likely to switch when they are in situations where they are able to learn the rules of such games. However, switching is something a majority of people fail to do at first glance due to many reasons, including illusions of control or the value they put on their feelings after deciding. <nl><nl><question2><nl>Moral Reasoning (MR) is the process of using logic to determine whether an action or decision is right or wrong. Utilitarianism and Deontology, established from Bentham (1748-1833) and Kant (1724-1804), are forms of MR and are associated with systems for decision-making.<nl><nl>Deontological forms of MR argue that the right thing to do depends on actions’ intrinsic value, e.g. the act of lying is bad. Holyoak and Powell (2016) discuss deontology and say that it acknowledges individuals’ unique positions in situations. They mention a number of factors that occur within deontological ethics such as, doing versus allowing (actively harming versus allowing harm), intentions (being judged for an action’s intentions) and preferential treatment for important relationships. <nl>In terms of systems, deontology associates with system 1 response characteristics, which refers to fast and primitive evolutionary thinking.<nl><nl>Utilitarian forms of MR are seen as consequential and the theory argues that the right act is the one that maximises the greatest utility for the group of individuals. Holyoak and Powell address that utilitarianism is linked to the idea of economic utility and cost-benefit analyses. This differs from deontology as it focuses solely on the best consequences which are seemingly the total wellbeing of the involved individuals.<nl>Utilitarianism is perceived as a system 2 response, which is analytical and uses new evolutionary tactics. Supportive evidence for two systems in MR was given by Greene et al. (2001). They found that in instances of the personal and impersonal versions of the trolley dilemma (deciding whether to push a lever to save the 5 lives or deciding to push a large individual), individuals who made ‘utilitarian responses’ (to push) took longer to think, and brain imaging revealed that brain regions more closely related to working memory were active, compared to those who made deontological responses – who showed more activity in brain regions related to emotions. Differences in neural activity support the idea that there are possibly two different systems used in moral decision-making.<nl><nl>So far, utilitarian &amp; deontological forms of MR appear very different (actions versus consequences), even via neural structures. However, critics suggest that deontological reasoning is another form of utility. Cohen and Ahn (2016) argue for a single process model rather the dual systems. They asked participants to rate items and people (to display differences in individual utility) and once incorporated into the trolley dilemma, they found correlations with the reaction times &amp; probabilities of making a deontological decision and how similar items’ utility value were. This could suggest that deontological decision-making may just be what the decision-maker holds valuable to them.<nl>A similar idea of this lack of distinction was proposed by Ditto and Liu (2011) who argued that those who make deontological responses use consequentialism. They asked people how many individuals would need to be saved in order for them to push another individual and found that participants who gave the deontological response spoke about higher likelihoods of the individuals escaping the train track and low possibilities that pushing the man would stop the trolley. This suggests that even when they make their decision, they’re using consequentialism, suggesting the theories aren’t separate.<nl><nl>More criticism is proposed on whether the distinction between the two theories is valid or whether it’s a misconception, as Gray and Schein (2012) argue that morality is defined by the combination of two minds (moral agents- the actors, and moral patients- the sufferers), As a combination, they argue that neither deontology nor utilitarianism can account for MR on their own. Because of this, they also bring up the idea that paradigms that set utilitarian and deontological reasoning against each other provides false concepts of MR. <nl>Likewise, Kahane (2015) discredits the use of sacrificial dilemmas- which much research on MR is founded on - to assess the difference between any forms of MR. One reasons he gives refers to the idea that in some dilemmas, the option to sacrifice puts the individual in a position where the decision could be made out of self-interest. <nl><nl>Deontological forms of MR appear to be about an agent’s intentionality whereas utilitarianism refers more to consequences. There is conflicting consensus about whether they’re two different systems but there's criticism about the fact that as theories, they aren’t necessarily distinctive, more importantly, the use of dilemmas to assess the forms of MR are not beneficial and do not account for MR in the real world. Dilemmas like this are also snapshot instances and its very questionable as to whether these theories can describe MR outside said dilemmas.<nl><nl>", "lo,<nl><nl>Unfortunately, I lost the previous email, so again I am unsure on who to address the letter to.<nl><nl>Many thanks,<nl><part_FN><new>Hello,<nl><nl>I was wondering if I could  request an application form, in order to apply for the part time student telethon caller job.<nl><nl>Thank you<nl><part_FN><new>Hello,<nl><nl>I accept the offer.<nl><nl>Many thanks,<nl><part_FN><new>Hello,<nl><nl>I was wondering what theme <topic> would come under.<nl><nl>Many thanks<nl><part_FN><new>Hello,<nl><nl>I was wondering for  the presentation on <day>, will we be required to dress formal?<nl><nl>Many thanks<nl><part_FN><new>Hello,<nl><nl>I have attached the bibliography below.<nl><nl>Thank you <nl><part_FN> <new>Hello,<nl><nl> <nl><nl>Initially for my placement, I was meant to be going to <university>, however due to the covid-19 situation this has been cancelled.

{"id": "069e4e32-fe5e-4687-a2b6-689ad2cdcf27", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["\"The mercantile law… is the same all over the world. For… the same premises, the sound conclusions of reason and justice must universally be the same\". This opinion led to the signing of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) in 1980, coming into force on 1st January 1988. Operating on \"contracts of sale of goods between parties whose places of business are in different States\", and aiming to provide a set of default, harmonised rules to be applied in the absence of specified terms, the CISG has been adopted in ninety-four states as of September 2020.<nl>However, the UK is not a signatory; instead, English sale of goods law is governed by the Sale of Goods Act 1979. The dominance of English law in this field, demonstrated by the mirroring of it within the Hong Kong Sale of Goods Ordinance, means that if the UK ratified the Convention, it would undermine the position of its domestic law, potentially causing the loss of its international status. This alongside the CISG’s civil law influences, resulting in \"rules foreign to… the common law’ of the UK, and the lack of comprehensive cover offered by the Convention, with no mention of areas including the passing of property, makes it ‘less suitable to commodity sales than the English Sale of Goods Act’. As such, the UK government has historically seen no demand for ratification of the CISG. <nl>The commercial law on international sale of goods \"aims at establishing certainty and trust and the reduction of transaction costs\". In exploring and comparing the remedies available under both the CISG and SGA, this essay will examine the extent to which English domestic law remains capable of this; or whether the Convention \"would be a useful addition to (or in certain circumstances, replacement of) English sale of goods law as it currently exists\".<nl>Overall, I will argue that English common law promotes the most commercial certainty, and therefore ratification of the CISG is not required as an addition or replacement of the Sale of Goods Act 1979.<nl><nl>Remedies<nl>Typical of a common law jurisdiction, English law adopts a restrictive approach to remedies. Under which, the measurement used for determining remedies available is the importance to the parties of the contractual obligation being breached – differentiating between breach of a major term (\"condition\") and a lesser term (\"warranty\"). However, the classification of each term remains a matter for judicial interpretation based on the construction of the contract; this dual system being criticised as overly simplistic. The trivialisation was demonstrated when the Court of Appeal first made reference to a third classification – ‘innominate’ terms – whereby a breach may or may not lead to the right of repudiation, depending on the severity of the breach. <nl>Meanwhile, the CISG was designed considering the special characteristics of the international sale of goods, including the long distances involved, costs of transportation and length of the term of the contracts. To accommodate such factors, the Convention adopts a more permissive remedial approach, as common for a civil law jurisdiction. Set out in Article 45(1) and 61(1), remedies available depend on the breach severity, measured in relation to a ‘fundamental breach’, as defined to be an act that \"results in such detriment to the other party as substantially to deprive him of what he is entitled to expect under the contract\" . However, the Article \"does not provide clear guidelines for distinguishing fundamental breach from non-fundamental ones\" and case law, such as Doolim Corp v R Doll and Bundesgericht, does not clarify the differentiation either. <nl>As such, both the CISG and English law provide similar provisions for determining remedies available, each resulting in uncertainty. Initially, the warranty and conditions system under the SGA appears to promote certainty considering s12-15 SGA establish items designated to be conditions and warranties. However, the mention of \"innominate terms… 'fatally' remove[s this] element of certainty which is an essential provision in contracts and gives rise to an increasing number of arbitrations\". Similarly, Grebler details the uncertainty associated with defining ‘fundamental breach’ under the CISG in terms of the phasing of Article 25; explaining how the conditions, exceptions and affirmative statements within the same sentence antagonise its accurate interpretation. Hence demonstrating that both systems harbour their own uncertainty; failing to imply one is any more favourable than the other.<nl><nl>Damages<nl>Under the SGA 1979, damages serve as the primary remedy – drawing \"a distinction between a provision for a \"penalty\", which is not valid, and a provision for \"liquidated damages,\" which is valid\". Whilst other remedies exist under domestic law, and \"parties are generally free to choose their own remedies, English law will not enforce all the remedies, at least not to the same degree\". <nl>Alternatively, damages are also available under Article 74 of the CISG, which places no limit on the amount of compensation that parties can agree to pay upon breach of contract. To the same effect, damages under the CISG can also be claimed in conjunction with other remedies provided overcompensation does not occur. This flexible approach can also be seen in the principle of freedom of contract in Article 6, whereby parties can derogate from the Convention, including Article 74, in order to replace them with bespoke clauses, such as one on remedy and damages available. National law would then govern the validity of such clauses, which will be upheld in place of their CISG alternative, as seen in ICC International Court of Arbitration Award No 99781999. This being said, whilst this gives parties the freedom to establish their own remedies, they will not necessarily be enforced uniformly between countries as elements such as penal clauses are a matter of public policy, to be dictated by the jurisdiction in which the contract operates.<nl>This demonstrates that whilst \"[the] CISG approach has the merit of being more transparent and truer to the commercial purpose of very many contracts… the Sale of Goods Act approach… may be the easier to apply\". The Convention undeniably allows for a more flexible approach to damages, compared to the more limited scope of the Sale of Goods Act 1979. However, if this flexible approach, caveated by domestic law, cannot be applied and interpreted uniformly, it fails to provide the harmonisation of law that it aims to achieve; instead generating uncertainty that would be detrimental, and not a useful addition, to English law if incorporated.<nl><nl>Specific performance<nl>The doctrine of specific performance \"reflect[s] the principle… that the law should compel parties specifically to perform their contractual obligations\". Under English law, a remedy of specific performance is available under s52 SGA 1979 but is only available to the buyer, and is only granted in exceptionally rare circumstances where the \"courts of equity were without jurisdiction unless the remedy at law was inadequate\", as demonstrated by Lord Hoffman in Co-Operative Insurance Society Ltd v Argyll Stores. Whilst the doctrine in theory \"applies to all cases where the goods are specific or ascertained, whether the property has passed to the buyer or not\", there is no guarantee that the court will always exercise its discretion and enforce specific performance, even in instances where the buyer has struggled to obtain replacement goods such as custom machinery or a ship. As such, this discretionary approach under English law demonstrates a lack of uniformity in application that has been criticised for being detrimental to commercial certainty.<nl>Concurrently, under Articles 46 of the CISG, a \"buyer may require performance of the seller of his obligations unless the buyer has resorted to a remedy which is inconsistent with this requirement\", with a mirrored provision for the seller under Article 62. The lack of a requirement for the goods to be specific and identified under the contract, allows these articles to avoid \"some of the uncertainty associated with the scope of specific performance under the SGA\". However, \"due to the divergent common-law and civil-law perceptions…, the… CISG included article 28 as a compromise\", which \"seeks to preserve domestic law regarding the availability of specific performance\". As such, \"a court is not bound to enter a judgment for specific performance unless the court would do so under its own law\", as demonstrated in Magellan International Corporation v Salzgitter Hanbdel GmbH. This article therefore makes the remedy of specific performance discretionary rather than mandatory, and creates its own uncertainty as this caveat is \"disruptive [of] the Conventions underlying goal of uniformity\".<nl>Overall, the approach of English law means that the \"precise scope of when a court might have the power or discretion to grant specific performance is… unclear\". The adoption of the CISG \"will have the opportunity to clarify English law on this point\", and may allow for the widening of the scope of application based on its less restrictive definition. However, the inclusion of Article 28 means that the CISG cannot replace domestic law on this matter, and given the reluctance of the English courts to enforce s52(1) SGA, it is unlikely that the addition of the CISG to English law would result in any expansion of the doctrine, or additional commercial certainty. Instead, it is likely to cause further confusion due to the lack of uniformity in its own application, thus resulting in further costs when settling the inevitable increase in related disputes.<nl><nl>Granting of additional time (‘Nachfrist’)<nl>The Sale of Goods Act 1979 contains no express remedy for the granting of additional time in order to perform contractual obligations. S10 of the Act contains stipulations regarding timing of contracts, deeming remedy only to be available on these grounds if timing is of the ‘essence’.  Whilst the House of Lords confirmed that time stipulations in mercantile contracts will typically be considered to be of the essence, the shift away from considering breaches in terms of ‘conditions’ and ‘warranties’ results in further uncertainty. This being said, under English law the non-breaching party can grant additional time, as per s11(2) SGA, by waiving the original contractual term and establishing a new notice making the new time frame to be of the essence, as in Stickney v Keeble. <nl>Similarly, under the CISG, Articles 47 and 63 provide for the allowance of additional time as seen in civil jurisdictions, and referred to as Nachfrist after the similar German law remedy. Rooted in the CISG’s aims of maintaining viability of contract, rather than avoiding them, Nachfrist allows for ‘reasonable’ periods of delay in performance of contracts. However, as with English law’s approach, uncertainty stems from the ‘reasonability’ element of this requirement. Such uncertainty, leading to increasing disputes and ultimately higher costs of transaction, as in Germany Oberlandesgericht where whilst the original fixed period of two weeks agreed was deemed an ‘unreasonable’ addition, the seven weeks that followed were held to be ‘reasonable’ based on the facts.<nl>In both systems, whilst the approach differs, the granting of the additional period in both is seen to be a \"kind of estoppel\" preventing the non-defaulting party from seeking other remedies during this period, but for the avoidance of the contract if the additional period is not met. Equally, both systems \"give the defaulting party the protection of a reasonable time, at the expense of the innocent party's certainty of when a time period would be considered reasonable\". As such, there would unlikely be any benefit to incorporating the CISG into English law in this respect in terms of commercial certainty gained or expansion of the doctrine.<nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>\"In Commercial Law, the parties plan and negotiate their transactions based on their understanding of the legal rules that govern their transactions, and in the expectation that these rules will remain… stable in the future.\" As such, to consider incorporating the CISG into English domestic law, there would have to be notable benefits associated to outbalance the uncertainty and unfamiliarity of the new rules.<nl>Having first come into effect in 1983, and not having been updated more recently than 1979, the Sale of Goods Act would benefit from expansion and modernisation. Comparatively to the CISG, the remedies available are far more restrictive, as demonstrated by the more restricted scope for damages and limited willingness to apply principles including specific performance and the granting of additional time. Whilst all such remedies are accounted for under both the SGA and the CISG, the SGA’s approach has been criticised for giving insufficient gravitas to the complex and logistical nature of the international sale of goods. Comparatively, as the Convention borrows from a range of both common and civil law jurisdictions, it is considered to be more up to date with modern requirements of international trade, and representing of global best practices, for example catering for the ‘reasonable’ delays resulting from many transactions easily under Nachfrist rather than requiring the explicit waiving and recreation of terms.<nl>This being said, \"[an] extremely important goal for the CISG is to achieve… uniformity and certainty with regard to remedies available\", yet \"[no] international commercial legal regime can expect to be perfect, especially when it is developed on the basis of compromise between legal systems\". The required compromise is particularly evident in Article 28 of the CISG, explicitly giving domestic law superiority over the Convention in terms of specific performance. It is this compromise between common and civil jurisdictions that means that the CISG ‘contains hidden complexities which can easily lead to errors’, as in FilantoS.p.A. v Chilewich International Corp, that would likely result in an increased number of disputes if incorporated into English law.<nl>As such, I believe the outcome from the previous two consultations carried out by the UK Department of Trade and Industry on the possible incorporation of the CISG in 1989 and 1997  stands – ratification is not a priority. Whilst it would bring the UK in line with many of its global trading partners, ‘in all mercantile transactions the great object should be certainty… because speculators in trade then know what ground to go upon\",  and \"[no] matter what the merits or drawbacks of the CISG, it cannot instantly create the same measure of legal certainty and is therefore condemned to exclusion so long as English law, or rather courts and arbitrators applying English law, do their job well\". In kind, following PST Energy 7 Shipping v OW Bunker Malta (The ‘Res Cogitans’), ‘many similar cases worldwide await[ed the] decision with interest’, showing the global dominance of English law on the sale of goods remains intact. Thus, as it currently stands, the CISG remains an unnecessary addition to, or replacement for the law; instead, it should remain a guideline of global standards of best practice to which the UK can compare its own domestic law.", "<addr4_FN>,<nl><nl>Not to worry, I did think it was a long shot but thought it worth an ask!<nl><nl>I will definitely take you up on the <system> appointment for feedback as soon as the marksfeedback are released!

{"id": "201702f0-1c54-43ab-a72d-443ff29f4f47", "discourse_types": ["essay", "memo"], "pair": ["Abstract <nl>59 undergraduate psychology students replicated the Stroop test (Stroop, 1935) by identifying the colour of the font of 60 stimulus words in two conditions: congruent, where the ink colour is consistent with the word itself, and incongruent, where the ink colour is different to the word itself. The results showed that the reaction time for the incongruent condition was longer than the congruent condition. This can be supported by the selective attention theory, which states that it requires more attention to name the ink colours than to read the words (Johnston and Dark, 1986). The future implications of the Stroop test and results of the study involve the ability to identify certain brain regions (MacLeod, 2015). <nl>Introduction<nl>The Stroop Test, introduced by Stroop (1935), is a neuropsychological test which assesses the ability to suppress cognitive interference when the processing of one stimulus slows down the processing of a second stimulus (Scarpina and Tagini, 2017). In Stroop’s first experiment, he used five words and their matching ink colours, and participants were instructed to read each word aloud as fast as possible. In experiment 2, participants had to read the ink colours aloud rather than the word itself. The experimental condition was incongruent as the word was not the same as the colour of the ink. Participants had a longer reaction time when they were instructed to name the ink colour of the incongruent words compared to the congruent words in the control condition (MacLeod, 1991). <nl>This effect can be explained by the selective attention theory, as naming the ink colours required more attention than reading the words, hence these simultaneous stimuli were processed differently (Johnston and Dark, 1986). The interference Stroop effect demonstrated further led to the development of the Stroop Test. Literature suggests that this is a consistent effect, with results of the Stroop test having high reliability (Siegrist, 1995). This gives rise to the hypothesis that the reaction time for the incongruent condition, where the words and font colour are different, will be longer than the congruent condition.<nl>Method<nl>Participants:<nl>59 undergraduate psychology students from their first year at Aston University were recruited for this experiment via opportunity sampling.<nl><nl>Design:<nl>The design was repeated measures and the independent variable was the congruency of the font colour and the meaning of the word itself, with two levels being congruent and incongruent. The dependent variable was the reaction time (in milliseconds) for participants to name the font colour in each condition.<nl><nl>Materials:<nl>PsychoPy was used to implement the design of the experiment and collect reaction time data. The stimulus words for the congruent condition were ‘red’ in a red font, ‘green’ in a green font, and ‘blue’ in a blue font. The stimulus words for the incongruent condition were ‘red’ in a green font, ‘green’ in a blue font, and ‘blue’ in a red font. The response options available were the left arrow for red, the up arrow for green, and the right arrow for blue. <nl><nl>Procedure:<nl>Participants gave informed consent prior to conducting the experiment. They were instructed to identify the colour of the font the word was printed in, by pressing the corresponding responses on the keyboard. The stimuli were presented in a randomised and counterbalanced order. Participants saw the 6 stimulus types 10 times, with 60 trials in total. They then identified the colour of the font of the words by pressing the keyboard as fast as possible, with the keyboard response signalling the next trial. The reaction times for each trial were stored and saved for further analysis.<nl><nl>Results<nl>Table 1.<nl><table><nl><nl>As the hypothesis suggested, the mean for the incongruent condition is higher than the congruent condition (Table 1). The low standard deviations show that results did not vary highly in both conditions, suggesting that results may be consistent within each condition. <nl>A Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed that there was a statistically significant difference in reaction times between incongruent and congruent conditions at a 95% confidence level (Z= -3.638, p= .001). <nl><nl>Discussion<nl>The research hypothesis was supported as the reaction time for the incongruent condition was significantly longer than that of the congruent condition, which was consistent with previous research by Stroop (1935).<nl>A limitation of the study was the small sample size and type of participants tested, as the results from only 59 undergraduate psychology students fail to produce an accurate representation of the general population. This is shown by Hackshaw (2008), explaining that small sample sizes produce results which overestimate the magnitude of the difference. To improve this, a wider sample size extending outside of the university would be required to assess whether the results are truly reliable. Additionally, the risk of demand characteristics due to the Stroop test being well-known may mean that participants would deliberately take a longer time to identify the colour of the font in the incongruent condition compared to the congruent condition. Research participants are likely to hypothesise an aim of the study when they are aware that they are being observed (Hogg and Cooper, 2007). This could be remedied by introducing a pilot study where participants are asked about their perception of the aim of the study upon completion, allowing for the adaptation of the instructions and presentation of stimuli according to their responses. <nl>Future implications of the Stroop test include its ability in testing the function of associated brain regions (MacLeod, 2015), and the understanding of cognitive interference. This therefore allows for further research on brain regions related to the Stroop test, assisting in treatment and recovery of individuals with brain damage in these areas. Future research testing various groups of people, such as cognitively impaired, could provide useful when investigating which brain regions affect reaction times in the incongruent condition, demonstrating the full extent of the effect of the Stroop test.", "1. The CEO is booked for a two-day conference from the 2nd - 4th September in Helsinki, Finland. 2.

A walking distance away, exactly 0.61 miles left to her hotel, is the cafe called 'Little Big Cafe 2nd' where she can have breakfast every morning. 4. To learn about the city's history, she can visit The National Museum of Finland. This is a 10 minute hired car ride or 17 minute journey using transit. She will need to take the number 7 tram for a journey of 4 stops which departs every 12 minutes. 5. She can visit the Rauintala Kitchen and Table Helsinki for her dinner during the evening. It is a restaurant that serves typical national dishes. It is a one minute car journey or walking distance of 0.8 miles from her hotel. 6. To buy a souvenirs, she can visit Port of Helsinki Souvenirs. This is an 8 minute car journey from the hotel or via transit, it is 25 minutes. She will need to take bus 14 from outside the hotel which departs every 20 minutes. 7. There are many activities to do in the evening, particularly if she does not like opera. She can visit the Linnanmaki amusement park for her evening on the 2-3rd September. She needs to take the tram number 8 to get there which departs every 12 minutes and takes 28 minutes. 8. She can also visit The Alexandra Theatre by taking the bus number 22 where she can watch live dance, theatre and music performances (not the opera as she does not like it). On the 4th September, there is a theatre show called 'Fabulous Backstrom Brothers Show' playing at 7pm in the evening."]}

The model is ‘predicated on the notion that individual actors purse goals efficiently’ (Outhwaite et al., 2007). The term Homo Economicus is used to describe consumers and their sole aim of ‘utility maximisation’ (Fine., 2016). In-kind and unconditional cash transfers can be used by governments to aim to raise utility and welfare of specific groups in an economy. The effectiveness of these methods may depend upon many factors such as the target group of consumers, the area of consumption they aim to impact and the monetary value of the intervention.<nl><nl>An in-kind transfer is a ‘transfer payment’ that is ‘made in a specific good or service rather than cash’ (Cengage.com., 2013). There are 3 main types of in-kind transfers; the provision of vouchers such as food stamps, the use of subsidies and providing free access to a good or service, for example, the NHS in the UK. In-kind transfers allocate the benefit provided to specific goods or services, for example, the UK Healthy start scheme provides a targeted group with ‘vouchers that can only be spent on specific healthy foods’ (Griffith et al., 2018). It was found the impact these vouchers had upon raising utility depended on how highly the consumer values healthy foods. Diagram 1 shows the impact a healthy food voucher has upon infra-marginal consumers.<nl><figure><nl>Infra-marginal consumers already spend more than the vouchers worth on healthy foods as they value these goods highly and therefore a steep indifference curve is used. They are willing to sacrifice a high proportion of other goods to gain a small extra amount of healthy foods. In the diagram, the food voucher is represented by the line A-C. The voucher has caused an increase in utility for the consumer as represented by the rightward shift in the indifference curve from U1 to U2. The original point of maximum utility is represented by point X and the new higher maximum utility point is represented by point Y. The provision of food vouchers to infra-marginal consumers has positively impacted utility. Whilst utility has increased, the impact the voucher has had upon these consumers is very ‘similar to an income-equivalent cash benefit’ (Griffith et al., 2018). This means that providing an unconditional cash transfer to these consumers instead of the vouchers would have a similar effect on utility. They are still likely to spend the additional cash on healthy foods.<nl><nl>On the other hand, distorted consumers do not value healthy foods as highly and therefore the voucher has a different effect upon their utility. Diagram 2 displays the effect of the food voucher upon distorted consumers.<nl><figure><nl>The lower utility received from consuming healthy foods is represented by a flatter indifference curve and this displays the lower marginal rate of substitution. This means that in comparison to diagram 1 the initial maximum utility point X occurs at a much lower quantity of healthy foods. The voucher causes a shift in the indifference curve from U1 to U2 and therefore increases the utility from point X to point C. This shows that the vouchers are effective in raising utility for this group of consumers. However, the line C-E represents the cash alternative of the voucher. Here we can see that if these consumers were provided with cash instead of vouchers the higher maximum utility point of Y can be reached. This shows that these consumers are unlikely to purchase healthy foods if provided with a cash alternative to the vouchers. They would instead choose to purchase a variety of other goods and services. For distorted consumers, the food vouchers are less effective in raising utility and the consumers would prefer to receive a cash payment.<nl><nl>Unconditional cash transfer programmes ‘aim to improve well-being by providing cash to targeted poor households without placing any conditions on the household’s actions’ (Institute for Financial Studies., 2018). Consumers are therefore not restricted on how they spend this money. Providing consumers with additional cash to spend effectively increases their income. The rational choice model assumes that consumers will act rationally and use any additional income to maximise utility. However, behavioural economics challenges this and suggests that the use of labels for these cash payments can influence how the consumer spends this additional money. Behavioural economics ‘adds elements of psychology to traditional models in an attempt to gain a better understanding of decision making’ (Sloman et al., 2018). For example, the UK Winter Fuel payment is a ‘cash transfer to older households’ (Beatty et al., 2014). ‘Robust evidence of a behavioural effect of labelling’ (Beatty et al., 2014) was found in relation to this unconditional cash transfer. The study found that ‘on average households spend 47% of the WFP on fuel’ (Beatty et al., 2014). This is in comparison to an expected 3% being spent on fuel if the payment was simply treated as cash. Behavioural economic tools such as nudges can be used to alter how consumers spend their income. This is a clear example of nudge theory and shows that ‘positive reinforcement’ ‘can persuade people to make a particular choice’ (Sloman et al., 2018). ‘When a label is attached to a part of their budget, subjects change consumption according to the label’ (Abler et al., 2017). This evidence shows that consumers are responsive to behavioural economic policies and therefore do not always act like Homo Economicus as suggested by the rational choice model.<nl><nl>Overall, rational choice theory suggests that unconditional cash transfers are more effective at raising consumers’ utility. It allows consumers to purchase the goods and services they decide will maximise their own utility. However, in the long run, depending upon the area of consumption being targeted in-kind transfers may be more beneficial for raising overall welfare. For example, the healthy food vouchers provide families with food of a higher quality and that is more beneficial to their health. If they were instead provided with cash, as the distorted consumer example shows, there is a chance that this money would not be spend on healthy foods and instead it may be used to purchase fast food alternatives. This is then likely to have a long-term impact on health and could contribute to strains on the healthcare system in the future. If unconditional cash transfers are to be used, behavioural economic approaches can be adopted to influence how consumers spend this money to enable the intervention to have the most desired impact.", "lo,<nl><nl> <nl><nl>Do I have to state all of the placement start dates now?

Hotel U14 Autograph Collection (Unioninkatu 14) - this offers a room with an extra large double bed within a mile from the city centre and 0.8 miles of the beach for £308 (for both nights). This hotel looks very contemporary and also benefits from facilities including fitness centre and a restaurant. 2. Forenom Serviced Apartments (Kristianinkatu 11-13) - this offers a studio with two twin beds within a mile of the city centre and near the water also for £250 (for both nights). This option appears significantly more basic but would offer more independence as is self accommodating if that is what you wish for. - My research shows the Cafeteria Roastery (Runeberginkatu 31) to be the top rated breakfast cafe in the city centre so this would be my recommendation for breakfast. However, if staying at Hotel U14, there is an option to add breakfast for an extra £16 per night (totalling £342). - With regards to leisure activities for you to do in your free time during the trip, there is the Helsinki City Museum (Aleksanterinkatu 16) where you could get an insight into the history of the city, as well as the Apollo Live Club (Mannerheimintie 16) which has live music and comedic acts on Fridays and Saturdays. Both of which are reasonably priced and align with your interests. - There are countless restaurants in the city centre which would offer a variety of traditional cuisine (not involving sea food), though my recommendation would be Ravintola (Kasarmikatu 26) as this appears to offer a combination of fine dining with the traditional cuisine. - Finally there are a couple of large souvenir shops in the centre which would be perfect for you to get your children Finish souvenirs. My recommendations would be either Shop Helsinki-Mikebon (Simonkatu 9) or Kankurin Tapa (Phojoiseplanadi 35) which would be closer to your hotel. I am yet to book any of the above for your stay.

{"id": "6a6c7c69-33f1-48cc-9cc7-952fc4c1325e", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Expression of emotion is one of the key ways in which humans communicate with one another and this expression is executed in many ways through tone of voice, body language (Medjden et al., 2020), the language we speak (Sun et al., 2020) and most importantly, our facial expressions. To effectively communicate with facial expressions, humans need to be able to correctly recognise these emotions and respond appropriately. Here, the question of what constitutes correct recognition of facial displays of emotion arises. This is achieved when the perceiver recognises the emotion intended by the person expressing the emotion. Thus, according to this definition, correct recognition of emotion is very subjective, proving that recognition of facial displays of emotion is a non-universal process. There are many factors that determine the non-universality of this phenomenon, but for this essay, only three factors will be discussed: 1) culture (Widen et al., 2011), 2) gender (Spies and Sevincer, 2018), and 3) mental illness (Uljaravic and Hamilton, 2013). This essay reviews the literature surrounding these factors and aims to support the argument of correct recognition of facial displays of emotion being non-universal with a wide range of convergent evidence.<nl><nl>The main factor to consider when arguing that recognition of facial displays is not universal is the role of culture. There has been vast amount of research that proves that culture does indeed influence emotion recognition. For example, studies by Widen et al (2011) found that culture influences the recognition of the basic emotions (Ekman and Friesen 1976). They conducted two studies: the first one involved 88 university students from Boston college rating 10 different facial expressions – first with a free label format and then with a forced-choice format. The second study employed the exact same method, but they increased the list of choices in the forced-choice task to include the three most commonly mentioned states (confused, thinking, suspicious) and a \"none of the above\" option. They found that although there was moderate agreement on the predicted emotion when assessed with forced choice (study 1: 58%; study 2: 42%), there was significantly low agreement when participants were assessed with free labelling (study 1: 18%; study 2: 16%). Therefore, this contrast in agreement in the different conditions possibly suggest that the options presented in a forced choice task may influence and shape their answer, meaning it is not the ideal task type to use when conducting emotion recognition research. Moreover, free labelling tasks have more ecological validity, making them more valid than forced choice tasks. <nl><nl>However, as with any psychological research, this study has limitations. While the researchers made sure to include individuals from various backgrounds in their sample size, the main drawback is that all of the participants had some exposure to Western, US culture as they were all university students at an American university. This means that even participants who maybe were not US citizens, still had been exposed to Western culture to an extent which may have influenced their answers and thus, the data of the culturally diverse participants would not be as accurate as if they had never moved to the US. Therefore, it is important to consider research that has employed participants from non-Western backgrounds. <nl><nl>Neuroimaging research conducted by Harada et al (2020) shows emotion recognition is influenced by culture by showing that neural activity in certain brain areas was different among participants from different ethnic backgrounds and that in-group biases influenced this activity. The study involved 3 groups of participants; native Japanese (JP) individuals who lived in Japan, Caucasian Americans (CA) and Japanese Americans (JA) both of which lived in the US. The study involved an fMRI scan of the participants while they completed an emotional face and perceptual matching task, viewing stimuli of either Japanese or Caucasian faces depicting negative emotions (fear or anger) or simple shapes that served as control. The results of this study show that in-group biases and collectivistic values influence cultural modulation of neural response in the bilateral amygdala. Furthermore, bi-cultural JAs showed enhanced neural responses in the ventral medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices during the perception of Japanese negative facial expression which suggests greater sensitivity to ingroup biases in individuals from more than one culture. Thus, this study is a prime example of how culture can shape emotion recognition – if this was a universal phenomenon, then all participants would have had the same level of neural activity in the amygdala however that was not the case. Furthermore, the researchers also made sure to select participants from collectivist cultures – those who had never been exposed to individualistic cultures – which make the data more reliable as it is less likely to be influenced by Western norms. As culture plays a significant role in influencing emotion recognition of facial displays of emotion, credibility to the belief that emotion recognition is non-universal is given.<nl><nl>Another factor to consider when discussing whether correct recognition of facial displays of emotion is a universal process is the role of gender. Research has shown that gender influences emotion perception and recognition among humans. Indeed, a study conducted by Spies and Sevincer (2018) showed that women were much better than men at recognising whether smiles were genuine or not. They used a behavioural experimental paradigm whereby they had participants judge single and adjacent photos. The single photos involved both authentic and unauthentic smiles and participants were required to indicate which smile they thought the photo showed. The adjacent photos involved photos of the same person depicting either an authentic smile or an unauthentic smile. The results showed that women outperformed men in differentiating the two types of smiles in the adjacent photos condition. This therefore suggests that gender does play a role in recognition of facial displays of emotion. <nl><nl>However, it is important to note that this study only explores gender influence in this area in only one type of experimental paradigm – a forced choice test. An issue with this type of test is that it lacks ecological validity as in real life, people differentiate facial displays of emotion through various means for example, via their eyes. Indeed, a study by Hall et al (2009), using eye tracking techniques, found that women were quicker and more accurate in recognising expressions than men and they looked more at the eyes of the person in the photo stimuli than men. Thus, this study shows that by even using a different experimental technique (other than a forced choice task) gender differences in recognition of facial displays of emotion are still evident. <nl><nl>Mental illnesses also have proven to be an influencing factor in the correct recognition of facial displays of emotion. In a meta-analysis study by Uljarevic and Hamilton (2013), it was found that autistic individuals found it difficult to recognise facial displays of emotion. The systematic review involved 48 papers that all employed a behavioural study paradigm, that is, participants in the study were required to do a type of behavioural task. The results of this meta-analysis found a large negative effect size that suggests the autistic individuals have a general impairment in emotion recognition. <nl><nl>However, it is too presumptive to claim that the findings of this meta-analysis are applicable to other research investigating the role of mental illnesses on recognition of emotions using different experimental paradigms, i.e. those that deal with neuro-psychological data that is obtained through neuro-imaging techniques or other physiological methods. As highlighted before, the above study looked at studies that employed behavioural tasks. It is important to establish whether the findings of that study would still be prevalent when alternative techniques are used. <nl><nl>In support of this, a meta-analysis study conducted by Cuve et al (2018) found similar results to the previous study, but their analysis included physiological and eye-tracking studies. This study involved a review of 21 studies and the results showed that the majority of the studies suggested that individuals with autism show a level of active or reflexive avoidance to the eyes, consequently missing the subtle social cues conveyed through this particular body part. The eyes are a crucial part of the body in that they play a significant role in processing emotional expressions, especially negatives ones such as fear and sadness (Scheller et al 2012). <nl><nl>Therefore, in line with the previous meta-analytic study discussed in this essay, the findings of this study also suggest that individuals with autism struggle recognising facial displays of emotion, especially negative emotion. Thus, with research that strongly supports the notion that mental illnesses play a role in influencing recognition of facial displays of behaviour, the notion that this phenomenon is not universal but rather dependent on many factors is proven to be more credible.<nl><nl>Overall, the non-universality of correct recognition of facial displays of emotion is widely researched. The factors discussed in this essay all influence emotion recognition of facial displays in distinct ways; it seems individuals from different cultures perceive facial emotions differently, women, more than men, are more likely to correctly recognise facial displays of emotion and autistic individuals generally have a difficulty in distinguishing and thus recognising different emotions. It also important to note that while emotion recognition of faces can involve either positive or negative emotions, it is more often the case that these factors play a bigger role when individuals are required to distinguish between negative faces rather than positive ones. That is, non-universality of correct recognition of facial displays of emotion is more evident in negative emotions than positive ones.", "nks for the answers, really clarified a lot of things! <nl><nl> <nl><nl>To decide on the specific personality traits I wish to study, I've summarised the traits that each study looks at in a table.

Firstly, I shortlisted Hotel: Marksi By Scandic which is based in the Helsinki city centre. I have selected the Classic Double room package which costs £157 per night. This package includes free breakfast which will be delivered to my CEO at her room, which means she need not travel out to a café. This package also contains a free re-booking policy which is very good in case she needs to change her booking due to COVID and can do so without worrying about paying extra money. Secondly, in case my CEO wanted to travel to a café to eat breakfast, I have selected the Fazer Café Kluuvikatu 3, café which is also based in the city centre and offers breakfast. It is rated 4-5 stars which is a good option. A restaurant i shortlisted was: Rosemariini, this includes vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes which is good for diversity of food and options. It offers different payment methods but currently offers a take away service. the Second restaurant i chose which is better than the first option is: Lappi Ravintola. this is a traditional restaurant with 4-5 star ratings and offers a 4 course meal, table booking and different payment methods i strongly recommend my CEO to visit this restaurant. Thirdly, the souvenir shop i have chosen for my CEO to visit is called: Moomin Shop Forum. This is based in the city centre and has received 4-5 star ratings from TripAdvisor. This gift shop contains gifts such as books, toys, cups and clothes which is highly ideal and beneficial for my CEO to buy gifts for herself and children as they may like books and toys. This gift shop is also based in international Helsinki airport as well as all over Helsinki so is easily accessible to visit. Finally, I have selected Helsinki City Museum to visit, as this is based in the city centre, not too far from the hotel. This also includes online exhibitions which is beneficial in case COVID was to increase in September and my CEO would be left with nothing to do, if this did happen then my CEO could attend online exhibitions too.

{"id": "6bde7f8d-82c2-437c-a0fc-f10cded7bc4c", "discourse_types": ["essay", "text_message"], "pair": ["1. Compare and contrast deductive and inductive reasoning. Use examples to explain. <nl><nl>Deductive reasoning involves logical thinking, providing us with the means to determine valid arguments in one’s train of thought. Similarly, inductive reasoning is a way of increasing semantic information through generalisation, allowing us to come to conclusions about whether a statement is true or false. <nl><nl>Deductive reasoning is similar to inductive reasoning in that concrete or previously known knowledge affects performance on experimental tasks measuring components of ordinary language. For example, in deductive reasoning, our own beliefs effect the validity of conclusions we make because our world knowledge clouds our judgement. Wilkins, (1928) found participants’ beliefs caused conflict with the validity of syllogisms and as a result, their judgement was poorer. Beliefs effect the interpretation of premises, influencing reasoning and bringing about response bias, therefore affecting the validity of the conclusion made. Similarly, experiments on inductive reasoning show familiar content can remind a person of similar problems they solved in the past. Griggs &amp; Cox, (1982) called this the ‘Memory Cueing Hypothesis’ – individuals retrieve similar contexts or situations involving solving a similar problem from their long-term memory, reducing facilitation effects involved in reasoning. <nl><nl>Another distinction between these types of reasoning is the certainty involved in making conclusions. In inductive reasoning, there is no certainty that the conclusion made from premises are valid all the time, as validity of conclusions depends on factors such as premises given, intention of the argument or statement, as well as the amount of information available at the time. Contrastingly, deductive reasoning is not dependent on as many variables, and is much more clear-cut and direct. Deductive reasoning allows us to form completely valid conclusions all the time, due to logical systems this type of reasoning follows, such as formulisation. Therefore, the conclusion will follow from the premises with absolute certainty, unlike inductive reasoning.<nl><nl>2. Why do we find Wason’s selection task so difficult? <nl>Peter Wason’s selection task is a logic puzzle involving deductive reasoning, heavily influenced by Popper’s hypotheticodeductive method. Participants are presented with four cards and a simple rule, and are asked which cards they need to turn over to see if the rule has been broken. Performance in this task is only 15%, even if participants are asked to falsify the rule, not prove it right. Research suggests concrete content facilitates performance. Cheng &amp; Holyoak (1985) state that humans reason with context-dependent ‘pragmatic reasoning schemas’, involving knowledge about permissions, obligations and causations. These schemas function to predict and reason in unfamiliar situations. During the selection task, permission schemas are evoked along with a set of rules with familiar information in a given scenario. The corresponding schema matches information required to solve the task, and so permission schema facilitate performance, especially when concrete rather than abstract content is used. <nl><nl>Additionally, Wason’s selection task is found difficult when rules cannot be interpreted as a social contract. Cosmides, (1989) found the selection task is facilitated when involving social exchanges derived from his computational theory, specifically tasks requiring the participant to detect a ‘cheater’ trying to take the benefit without paying the cost of a contract. In the context of the selection task, the participant is detecting a ‘if P not Q’ card is exposing the cheat. Cheat detection is parallel with familiar realistic situations involving social interaction rather than ambiguous and context-free content. When a selection task uses abstract terms not involving social exchanges, participants find it harder to reason as the situation is unfamiliar and doesn’t entail benefits or losses. This highlights the importance of context in Wason’s selection task – when context is not given, performance decreases considerably.<nl><nl>3. What are the predictions of \"Subjective Expected Utility\" theory for human decision making. How have deviations been explained? <nl><nl>Subjective expected utility theory (SEU), (von Neumann and Morgenstern, 1944 &amp; Savage, 1954) describes decision making, stating when individuals make decisions, they will act rationally by trying to maximise their expected utility. SEU aims to simplify decision making via 5 axioms (completeness, transitivity, continuity, independence and ranking), which when considered, will maximise expected utility. <nl><nl>The transitivity axiom assumes people make choices transitively – if they prefer A to B and B to C, they should prefer A to C. Tversky, (1969) identified a deviation in this axiom, called ‘intransitivity of preferences’, stating that humans are, in reality, inconsistent in their preferences of choices due to individual differences in evaluative processes and because preferences vary temporally. Tversky conducted experiments using classic transitive preference scenarios and found participants’ preference ordering was inconsistent to the transitivity axiom. Classic scenarios are not logically compatible with the rationality of human decision making, because variability and individuality of decision making in realistic situations aren’t taken into consideration.<nl><nl>The independence axiom states preference of order between two choices with equal outcomes should not be affected by one another, even when a third gamble is involved. In other words, equal outcomes should cancel each-other out. A deviation in this axiom called the ‘Allais paradox’ (Allais, 1953), states the independence axiom fails to consider feelings like disappointment, as well as the rationality involved in choosing a gamble and potentially getting nothing from it. The Allais paradox states evaluations of gambles cannot be done independently of other gambles, as the independence axiom assumes. <nl><nl>These deviations highlight the importance for a newer theory to recognise the influence of rationality, and which involves a psychologically descriptive approach, for example the ‘multi-attribute utility theory’ which is more able to explain decision making in realistic scenarios where decisions are dependent on many independent variables.<nl><nl>4. Using a specific puzzle or problem of your own choice, write out a plan (including diagram) of how to solve it using a state-action tree. <nl><nl>This problem is the ‘Chicken River Crossing Puzzle’: A man has to get a fox, a chicken, and a sack of corn across a river. He has a rowboat, and it can only carry him and one other thing. If the fox and the chicken are left together, the fox will eat the chicken. If the chicken and the corn are left together, the chicken will eat the corn. The task is to find out how the man gets all 3 things to the other side of the river in one piece. <nl><nl>The solution to this puzzle is as follows: first, the chicken crosses the river in the boat, and the fox and corn are safe together on the other side. He goes back across, and then takes the fox across the river replacing it with the chicken, which is now on the other side. Since the chicken and corn cannot be left together, he takes the corn in his boat and switches the chicken for the corn, which he takes across and leaves it with the fox. He then returns to pick up the chicken and heads across the river one last time, where all his items are across the river safely.<nl><figure><nl><nl>5. What is \"creativity\" and how can it be assessed?  <nl><nl>Creativity is defined as one’s ability to generate innovative ideas and solutions, and is seen as a form of intelligence. Creative solutions are seen as valuable and insightful, often solutions that novice individuals may not have come up with themselves; in this regard, creative individuals are seen as experts in their domain, as they hold extensive knowledge giving them the ability to produce innovative and original solutions commonly acknowledged by wider society. <nl><nl>Various perspectives aim to assess creativity differently, for example the psychometric approach aims to objectively measure creativity. Creativity has been conceptualised as a form of divergent thinking by Guilford, (1956), which is a style of thinking that can lead to many possible solutions to the same problem. It requires both originality and flexibility. Psychometric tests of creativity include the ‘Unusual Uses Task’ by Guilford, (1967): the participant’s task is to create alternative uses for a common object. Four dimensions are used to score answers: flexibility, originality, fluency, elaboration. Participant’s demonstrate divergent thinking if they generate unusual yet valuable uses for the object. The ‘Remote Associates Test’ (RAT) was created by Mednick, (1962), who theorised that creativity involves associating nonidentical concepts which are considered dissimilar. In RATs, respondents are shown stimuli in the form of three words and are asked to identify a word to link them together, for example \"worm  shelf  end\". Here, the answer is book (book worm, book shelf, book end). Psychometric tests in assessing creativity have produced interesting results, especially the observed link between creativity and intelligence, however these methods often mix creativity and intelligence, or originality and creativity.

{"id": "835b3f7b-c045-4efc-867f-2d6fb30c7a40", "discourse_types": ["essay", "memo"], "pair": ["Deductive and Inductive reasoning are examples of propositional logic to construct thoughts into a valid argument. Deductive reasoning begins from a general statement that leads to a certain conclusion (Johnson-Laird, 2000; Rips, 1999; Williams, 2000). For example, ‘all noble gases are stable, helium is a noble gas, so helium is stable.’  Inductive reasoning begins with specific observations which lead to a conclusion that is likely to explain the observation and the conclusion may be used to predict future specific occasions (Johnson-Laird, 2000). An example would be if all children in one day care like Legos, it could be assumed all children like Legos. <nl>A similarity between the reasonings are that they are both used to provide a valid argument and are used often. Another similarity is that both reasonings follow premises in which they base their argument on.<nl>A difference between inductive and deductive reasoning is that deductive reasoning begins with a hypothesis and tests the hypothesis via an observation whilst inductive reasoning begins with observations and then moves towards a theory. This is because deductive inference is based upon theory whilst inductive inference is based on observations. There is also a difference in validity between the reasonings as deductive reasoning is more precise as if all the premises are true then the conclusion is true for example, ‘if all dolphins are mammals and all mammals have kidneys, all dolphins therefore have kidneys.’ However, even if the premises are true in induction, the conclusion is still not definitely true. For example, ‘if the first button I get out of a bag is a red button, the third button I obtain from the bag is red, therefore it is inductive logic to conclude all the buttons in a bag are red.’ Therefore, deduction is more accurate and quantitative whilst induction is more general and qualitative. Due to this, induction is used more in everyday life as it is harder to obtain a sequential set of facts that are known to be true in deduction.", "Itinerary for Conference to Helsinki: You will be staying at the Radisson Blu Seaside Hotel. The hotel has a lovely view as it is situated along the waterfront. The hotel offers a 1 bedroom suite for £378 for 2 nights with a complimentary breakfast for each morning of your stay in their restaurant the Bistro Gimmis.

During one of the days you will attend the Luomus, which is the Finnish Museum of Natural History where you can view the exhibits and have a guided tour if you wish to tell you about the history of the city. However, if you wish for an alternative museum there is also the Arteneum Art Museum which holds art from the 19th century onwards telling the history of Finland through art.

During no other period in the lifespan is the prevalence of death so high relative to health, with Steinberg (2013) reporting a dramatic spike in self-inflicted behaviours such as car accidents and crime. Adolescent behaviour and the reasons for its occurrence has posed a particular question for researchers. <nl><nl>The duel systems process model proposes that adolescent typical behaviour is caused by a developmental imbalance between the subcortical socioemotional system implicated in sensitivity to rewards and novelty, relative to the cognitive control system responsible for impulse and emotional control as well as decision making (Shulman et al, 2016). The model hypothesises that the early activation and maturation of the ventral striatum (specifically the nucleus accumbens and amygdala) in early adolescence increases one’s propensity for sensation seeking whilst the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is still maturing, therefore attenuating impulse control (Harden &amp; Tucker-Drob, 2011). It is predicted that sensation seeking behaviour increases at the early stages of adolescence and levels off as adulthood is reached, following an inverted ‘U’ shape trajectory. Harden &amp; Tucker-Drob (2011) assessed this using longitudinal data from over 7000 participants aged 12-24, looking at self-reported changes in impulsivity and sensation seeking. They found that mean levels of impulsivity declined through adolescence and levelled off when participants reached their mid-20s, consistent with neurobiological research suggesting heightened activation of the ventral striatum in early to mid-adolescence relative to children and adults (Barkley-Leveson &amp; Galván, 2014). This supports the claim that adolescent typical behaviour is a product of nature due to the profound influence of brain structures and their relative levels of maturity on sensation seeking behaviour.  Harden &amp; Tucker-Drob’s (2011) research is one of the first to report this trend using longitudinal data and to utilise such a large sample, representative of a diverse population. Furthermore, the use of such a large data set reduced the chance of type I errors. However, caution should be taken when drawing conclusions due to the risk of social desirability and response bias when using measures of self-report. <nl><nl>It has been asserted by some researchers that adolescents possess the ability to evaluate risky decisions to the same level as adults (Reyna &amp; Farley, 2006), begging the questions as to why this age group engage in risk behaviours to such a degree? Observational data suggests that peer influence is a primary factor contributing to adolescents heightened propensity for risk (Albert et al, 2013) with researchers suggesting adaptive benefits such as increasing peer status and peer affiliation with desirable social groups (Spear, 2010). Steinberg &amp; Gardener (2005) assessed the effects of peer contexts on risky decision making in 3 age groups including adolescents (13-16), youths (18-22) and adults (24+). All 306 participants completed 3 measures of risk orientation including 2 self-report measures and a computerised driving task named the Chicken Game. In this task participants were required to make decisions about whether to advance the vehicle once a traffic light turns from green to yellow (meaning an impending red light) with the possibility of a car crash if the car advances through a red light. Participants were randomly assigned either the peer condition where they would complete the task with 2 others or the alone condition. Steinberg &amp; Gardener found that each group engaged in comparable risk taking when alone but increased risk taking when in the presence of peers, more pronounced during middle and late adolescence. This suggest adolescents’ susceptibility to peer influence relative to adults when taking risk, implying the role of nurture and social contexts in adolescent typical behaviours. This study has important implications for interventions seeking to reduce risky behaviour amongst adolescence (i.e. juvenile delinquency) suggesting attention should be directed towards increasing resistance to peer influence in young people. However, this study has arguably low ecological validity as it unable to capture the complex dynamic of risk taking with peers outside of a laboratory setting.<nl><nl>In conclusion the cause of adolescent behaviour appears to be a combination of both nature and nurture influences, with research suggesting that peer influence may increase the brain’s risk and reward system sensitivity (Albert et al, 2013). Subsequently, the duel process model and effects of peer stimuli may co-influence risky behaviours seen in adolescents as young people spend most of their time with peers (Spear, 2010). Therefore, the claim that adolescent behaviour reflects the influence of nature more so than nurture is not supported. <nl><nl><question2><nl><nl>Research suggest adolescence is the greatest risk period for the emergence of psychopathological disorders, with mental illness affecting 1 in 5 young people (Powers &amp; Casey, 2015). In light of this, this essay shall seek to critically discuss how brain development may facilitate the high prevalence of psychopathology during adolescence.<nl><nl>Stress has been considered an important factor contributing to adolescents’ vulnerability to internalising disorders, namely anxiety (Romeo, 2010). Brain areas identified as being implicated in this increased vulnerability includes the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis which undergoes significant maturational changes and a reawakening during puberty (Spear, 2010). The HPA axis is responsible for controlling stress-induced hormonal secretion in response to stressors and does so by stimulating the release of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary gland into circulation (McCormick et al.,2010). Once released, ACHT acts to increase the production and release of glucocorticoid hormones, which then act upon the brain to predetermine future responses to future stress stimuli. Using a battery of acute stressors, Elland &amp; Romeo (2013) assessed the hormonal stress response of prepubescent rats, compared to that of adult rats and found a greater, more prolonged ACHT and corticosterone response in the younger rats compared to adults. Elland &amp; Romeo (2013) suggested that it takes twice as long for these hormones to return to baseline level in premid-adolescent rats following stress stimuli relative to adult rats. Reflective of the results seen in animals, researchers have speculated that anxious individuals may show a delayed HPA axis recovery following a stressor, which in turn may make them slower to adjust to novelty, giving rise to psychopathological vulnerabilities (Spear, 2010). Caution should be taken when interpreting these results to human behaviour because of the use of animal data. However, it is increasingly difficult to assess levels of glucocorticoid in human adolescents because of the natural diurnal release rhythm it follows (Spear, 2010), meaning animal studies have provided a valuable opportunity to investigate this, whilst having strong experimental control. Furthermore, animal research is able to bypass the ethical implications to be considered when conducting human research (Eiland &amp; Romeo, 2013). <nl><nl>Attention deficithyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) can be defined as inappropriate levels of inattention and hyperactivityimpulsivity relative to an individual’s age, that interferes with their functioning (Shaw et al., 2012). Onset of ADHD is around 7 years (occurring before puberty) and is prevalent in over 5% of children worldwide (Friedman &amp; Rapoport, 2015). Research has suggested that brain development through late childhood and adolescence is an important factor contributing to ADHD. Shaw et al (2007) assessed this using a longitudinal MRI scan study of 223 ADHD diagnosed participants matched with 223 typically developing (TD) controls.  Shaw and colleagues found a marked delay in ADHD in achieving peak cortical thickness throughout the cerebrum and prefrontal cortex (PFC). This delay was most pronounced in the middle and lateral PFC, implicated in higher-level cognitive functions such as attention and planning, where peak thickness was achieved 5 years later than TD controls. In addition to this it was seen that the primary motor cortex conversely showed early maturation in ADHD (peaking age 7 years), when compared to controls (peaking age 7.4 years). Shaw and colleagues speculated that the delayed developmental trajectory of regions implicated in higher-order motor control, paired with the early maturation of the primary motor cortex may account for symptoms seen in ADHD i.e. poor motor control. This influential study was seen to be the first longitudinal neuroanatomic research evidencing the theory of delayed cortical maturation in ADHD, due to the advanced in MRI techniques seen in recent history. However, it should be noted that the results cannot endorse differences in intelligence and sexual dimorphisms seen in ADHD, despite their effect on cortical development because they strictly controlled for in the design. <nl><nl>To conclude brain maturation and development in adolescents, relative to adults seems to have implications for various psychopathologies. Spear (2010) suggests for disorders like ADHD where onset occurs just prior to adolescence, motor control regions may show developmental anomalies, whereas disorders with adolescent aged onset i.e. anxiety, show developmental differences in the frontal regions. It can be speculated that the PFC’s immaturity in adolescents relative to adults, may be sensitive to the reawakening and prolonged effects of the HPA axis. However, brain development is not the only factor giving rise to psychopathologies in adolescents with mental health varying by person. Instead some researchers propose the stress-diathesis model, suggesting an interaction between genetic vulnerabilities and environmental stresses, predisposing certain individuals to psychopathologies during adolescence (Spear, 2010).", "iterally said that ^<new>Any time <new>Let me seeee<new>Ur HAIR<new>Oh no😭 <new>You gotta come back soon<new>LOOOOOOOOL<new>These gyal are joke <new>Don’t kill me <new>Is she young?<new>Defo <new>Thanks <new>I’m here now <new>Use the code <new>Sorry my love <new>That’s great love! don’t let nobody tomorrow ruin ur mood<new>Love you to<new>Stupid moist idiot <new>I hope no one shows up<new>More time it’ll be jobless people cause it’s actually <day><new>He actually boyyyyd it <new>I wanna be fucking out <new>Kmt it’s true <new>Sigh <new>So sad <new>Yesss<new>Bitch start saving we’re going to <country> <new>One slimey ting <new>Tastes like vomit "]}
{"id": "fc2769d0-b108-4b50-9cdf-cf8eafb4fa0b", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["The Covid-19 pandemic has led to the enforcement of drastic social distancing measures, which affect the ways in which students interact and socialise with one another. These measures conflict with the human instinct to connect with others, thus increasing social isolation and feelings of loneliness within students (Bavel, et al., 2020). This affects their wellbeing both directly, towards poor mental health and indirectly, as the underpinning reason behind the huge reduction in social interaction that students must now deal with (Burns, Dagnall, &amp; Holt, 2020). The objective of this research is to gain an insight into the importance of social interactions on the wellbeing of students, and how this has been impacted due to Covid-19. The main research question was therefore: ‘How have changes in the amount and quality of social interactions due to COVID-19 impacted the well-being of undergraduate students?’. Through this, a semi-structured interview was developed, which aimed to investigate the experience of changed social interactions, the impact this had on participant wellbeing, and their experience of coping mechanisms.<nl><nl>Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) as a suitable method<nl>Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) has been chosen as the most appropriate methodology for this research topic because it is concerned with the detailed examination of the participant’s personal lived experience (Willig &amp; Stainton Rogers, 2017).<nl>Analysis<nl>1 \"It’s overwhelming and draining\": negative impacts on wellbeing<nl>This superordinate theme explores the significant physical and psychological toll Covid-19 has taken on Feya, fostering a sense of powerlessness. She discusses the loss of control, predictability and security within her life during these unprecedented times.<nl>1.1 \"…I don’t see the light at the end of the tunnel\": depressive symptoms<nl>Here, Feya uses a metaphoric expression, of being in a tunnel with no light, to illustrate the sense of loss of control she feels over her life and the feeling that there is no way out of this ordeal. She sees no light, which otherwise symbolises hope, at the end of this dark, perpetual tunnel, that is her mind. This is further supplemented by her mention of feeling \"trapped\", which implies that she feels imprisoned by her own thoughts and is looking for an escape. Feya appears to be discontent with life and tired of \"staring at the same four walls everyday\". This is reiterated when she states that she is \"living the same day, every day\". She feels stuck, defeated and hopeless. This creates a powerful, cyclical imagery of her depressive thoughts as being inescapable, as she goes over the same worries over and over.<nl>\"…I feel really lonely, and a bit depressed and sluggish […] I feel like I’m locked in a box.\"<nl>Feya talks about the negative emotions felt amidst lockdown restrictions. The box Feya describes is a metaphorical representation of the confinements within her own mind, as well as the physical confinements within her home. She highlights being mentally drained and avidly waiting for lockdown to come to an end. Feya’s use of the phrase ‘mentally drained’ implies she is emotionally depleted and burnt-out due to the accumulation of stress in her personal life. In addition, Feya reiterates her fear of being ‘lonely\" later on, saying \"I feel like you have to go out and see people, otherwise […] you’ll drive yourself crazy\". This conveys her anxiety of being left alone to fight all of these overwhelming feelings by herself. The loneliness makes her feel vulnerable.<nl>Feya describes the bodily symptoms of depression, such as a loss of appetite and insomnia, which denotes how her feelings have clearly wreaked havoc on her physical wellbeing:<nl>\"When I’m drained, my appetite disappears, I can’t sleep and my mood’s just dull\"<nl>Feya describes the sudden, erratic nature of her sadness. The way her appetite ‘disappears’ without warning suggests that symptoms are unpredictable and out of her control. Her inability to sleep shows how overwhelming this experience is, as her mind is constantly racing with negative thoughts, to the extent where she feels disorientated. The use and repetition of the verb ‘drained’ connotes a powerful imagery of a pale, empty shell of a person, highlighting the invasive, destructive effects as a result of being in isolation.<nl>1.2 \"I’ve been so anxious about the future, because life as we know it, has changed\": anxious symptoms<nl>Within this superordinate theme, Feya alludes to her apprehensions about what the future holds post-pandemic. She is filled with apprehensions and worries. Feya talks about going through a \"really uncertain time\", most of which revolves around her professional and personal life. She expresses an unknowingness of \"all of this is going to be over\". The pronoun ‘all’ denotes that the current crisis has impacted every aspect of her life. It depicts the true extent of the impact of Covid-19. Feya expresses how powerless she feels:<nl>\"We can’t plan things out anymore\" <nl>Feya refers to the lack of control she feels, as her \"many plans and aspirations\" have been compromised. The use of the collective pronoun, ‘we’, denotes a sense of unity and acts as an attempt to regain a sense of control. It provides Feya with a sense of reassurance, that she is not the only one going through these hardships. She paints a picture of herself as being powerless, with no choice but to surrender to the virus. <nl>This is further exacerbated when Feya appears to be thinking out loud, searching for the answers to her many questions: \"Are we going back into lockdown, are we not, can we go into work, can we go to restaurants and see our friends?\" Feya is clearly stuck in her ruminations, which is an expression of her doubt and uncertainty regarding what the future holds.<nl>Feya describes the significant psychological distress she faced, induced by the abrupt nature of lockdown restrictions:<nl>\"I- I- I was really scared and cautious and careful\"<nl>The repetition of \"I\", where Feya appears to stumble over her words, sounds robotic and reflects how overwhelmed she felt at the time. There is a strong sense of fear and anxiety, depicted through her selection of words.<nl><nl>2 \"I felt so distant from them\": changes in social interactions<nl>This superordinate theme reflects the changes in Feya’s social habits and ways of social interaction. Feya describes feeling not only physically distant from her friends, but also emotionally. She complains about how they \"wouldn’t even be awake at the same time\", which creates a barrier that even digital interactions can’t overcome. She feels emotionally detached and isolated, indicating a clear disconnect with the outside world due to the Covid-19 crisis. This is further emphasised when Feya talks about losing the ability to socialise, saying she had \"forgot what it was like to even talk to friends\", which implies that being in social isolation had stifled her.<nl><nl>2.1 \"With your immediate family members who you’re living with, you get sick of and start bickering\": interpersonal tensions<nl>Here, Feya states how confinement with family members in her household has led to inevitable interpersonal tensions, as a result of stress and spending so much time together. The verb ‘bickering’ implies that they argue over trivial matters, which suggests that her ‘dull’ moods not only impact her own wellbeing but are also displaced onto others. <nl><nl>2.2 \"If it wasn’t for social platforms, I don’t know what I’d do\": shift from physical to digital communication<nl><tab>Feya describes social media as being an essential tool used to stay in contact with her friends and family. She explains that maintaining ties has \"moved from a physical form […] to a digital form\" and that everyone is just \"a call away\" now. <nl><tab>Though she expresses her gratitude for these platforms, she says it does not compare to face-to-face contact. This emphasises how important physical connection is to Feya – it’s a love language, which makes her feel ‘alive’ and connected.<nl><nl>3 \"I’m pretty distracted most of the time\": coping mechanisms amid pandemic<nl>The final superordinate theme portrays how Feya is coping with the pandemic. Feya talks about being a key-worker alongside a university student, so she feels that she hasn’t felt the impacts of the pandemic as severely as others. The adjective ‘distracted’ suggests she hasn’t truly dealt with the impacts of the pandemic, instead she has diverted her attention and energy towards studies and work to avoid reality.<nl><nl>3.1 \"I’ve just got to get on with it really\": acceptance<nl><tab>Here, Feya’s tone implies that she is ready to accept the uncontrollable nature of the Covid-19 virus and wants to proceed forward with her life, despite the turmoil it has caused. Acceptance is where the power lies, as Feya is able to find the control that she had previously lacked.<nl><nl>3.2 \"It’s enjoyable, it’s what life is about really\": maintaining close ties<nl>Here, Feya insinuates the importance of interpersonal connections through her use of language. She uses words which highlight the warmth that she feels in the company of her friends and describes how her mood ‘brightens up’ in their presence. She denotes the importance to continuously attend to and nurture her relationships in order to live a meaningful life.<nl>She talks about how seeing her friends has had a really positive impact on her mental health. She adds that she doesn’t feel \"as alone\" in their company, which shows how social interactions provide a sense of unity, ease and comfort. They provide her with reassurance that she’s not the only one going through these difficult times.<nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>Dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic has taken a toll on the social connectedness and wellbeing of Feya. She defines her experience of lockdown as being overwhelming, draining and uncertain, as a result of social distancing measures, university closures and reduced social contact. During the course of the interview, we see a shift from frustration to acceptance of the global pandemic, as she is forced to come to terms with reality.", "<addr11_FN>,<nl><nl>Very sorry, I joined the webinar but my computer has died because of a power cut :( hopefully I’ll be able to join again soon but I’m worried I’ll miss the break out rooms?

{"id": "15c7b5ef-9d11-40c9-92a9-dcf0e3dc44d6", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["The topic of research investigated was Perception of Beauty, this topic was chosen as a result of its major current infleunce within today’s society from influencing an individual’s perception of beauty about themselves and beauty as a social construct. Furthermore, the perception surrounding beauty has not just been relevant to within today’s society it also has had major influences throughout history in terms of the ideal body image evidently seen with icons such as Marilyn Monroe and desired hairstyles amongst culture throughout history. A Discourse Analysis inspired by Willig (2001) take on discourse, was used as it allowed for in depth understanding of themes and constructs which arose from the broad topic of beauty. Followed by the practices of these constructs whilst also adopting a subjective approach based on the interviewees experience. <nl>In addition, using a semi-structured interview was useful for this topic of research as it allowed for both freedom and interpretation of beauty whilst maintaining focus on the interviewees’ perception of beauty.  To ensure confidentiality the interviewee will be referred to by the pseudonym Susan. <nl>Discourse 1- ‘Beauty is beyond skin deep’ <nl>When asked to define beauty Susan’s demonstrates immediately categorises beauty into two categories ‘superficial’ and ‘deeper beauty’. Susan’s attitude towards the discourse of superficial beauty has already been perceived as negative, this is evident through the depth of explanation in which both types of beauty are described. <nl><data_excerpt><nl>Susan’s shallow explanation of the discourse of superficial beauty positions herself throughout interview as having a negative view of beauty being based on the outward appearance. This again is reiterated through her humour on the discourse, as she states ‘it’s like your outward beauty can get you so far coz you know when you grow old… You get a litt’l crusty’. The choice of the word ‘crusty’, suggests that one’s perception of beauty only being based on outward appearance is futile, as it essentially it will no longer be the determining factor of beauty.<nl>Contrastingly, Susan’s’ in-depth explanation on the discourse of inward beauty suggests the value in which she holds inward beauty as better a perception of beauty to have. The discursive list such as ‘character’, ‘personality’ and behaviour demonstrate the longevity of that aspect of beauty and its hierarchy which constructs Susan’s perception of beauty as it surpasses artificial beauty. <nl>Despite Susan positioning of inward beauty, it can be argued that the opposition of both discursive catergories highlights a sense of wanting inclusivity and identity in the way in which beauty is perceived. <nl><data_excerpt><nl>Susan’s avoidance of wanting to admit that superficial is more prominent than inner beauty, constructs the feeling of otherness surrounding outward appearance as it connotes a sense of isolation and division from what she desires to be beautiful versus society’s ideals of beauty. The themes which arise from the conflict of these discourses run throughout the interview. As Susan repeatedly positions herself against societies ideals of beauty and her own, this is evident through the consistent use of discursive pronouns ‘I feel likeI think’ and her separation from society as she states, ‘but in nowadays’ (lines 39 and 52).<nl>Furthermore, Susan further demonstrates the discourse of inclusivity through the specific type of social influencers she uses in response to the question asked in line 73.<nl><data_excerpt><nl>The examples used by Susan reaffirms this discourse, as the role models appear to display characteristics of the average human such as ‘embracing her tummy’. This non-superficial beauty demonstrated by the role models brings forth implications that Susan’s perception of beauty can also be accepted despite society’s perception of beauty. Furthermore, the discursive object of authenticity, can also be drawn from the examples used in regard to have a perception of beauty that everyone can obtain, this is further seen Susan refers to both sexes. <nl>Discourse 2- Outward beauty is not always negative<nl>Despite Susan presenting the negative aspects of outward beauty it can be argued whether outward beauty is completely negative.<nl><data_excerpt><nl>The discourse of style from outward beauty illustrates that outward beauty is not entirely negative as it can also be used as a guide to find one’s own beauty through style, as Susan admits that she was ‘terrible at dressing’. This also exemplifies how outward appearance constructs identity as similarly seen with Susan’s’ previous reference to Ashley Graham and Nella Rose as ‘good influences.’<nl>Moreover, within the discourse of style it can also be argued that not all aspects associated with outward beauty is superficial and negative. This is evident with the use of accessorises and ‘activities such as shaving or ear piercing’ (Sinkman, 2013), used to enhance beauty but is not deemed as a damaging percpetion of beauty concerning outward beauty, as it appears to be a construct accepted in society and to majority of individuals’. <nl>By the same token, from a business perspective it can be argued that the discourse of outward beauty is not entirely negative, regarding the profit made by brands such as L’Oréal, Mac and Huda Beauty Cosmetics, as the Business Insider reported that the beauty industry is ‘estimated worth $532 billion’. <nl>From both examples used above opposes, Susan’s initial perception surrounding the discourse of the outward appearance concerning beauty; this demonstrates the complexity surrounding the discourse of perceptions of beauty as it does not appear clear and cut.<nl>Discourse 3- The Medias’ perception of beauty is damaging<nl><data_excerpt><nl>Susan’s’ tempered response to the question asked in line 54 presents the discourse of media being the main reason behind the damaging perception of beauty in particular social media. Social media apps such as Instagram appear to be dominant discursive objects, which influence perceptions of beauty as themes such as self-gratification and acceptance. This is apparent within the example used by Susan as she illustrates a mother’s perception of beauty towards their child in comparison to Instagram’s perception of their beauty. Despite a mother voice having a significance of a child’s perception of themselves, it appears that social media drowns this voice as they quickly conclude that ‘I am not’ beautiful. This abrupt conclusion suggests that social media holds a lot weight regards to perceptions of beauty. <nl>Additionally, the repeated discourse of superficial beauty arose again in relation to the discursive object of social media, the conjunction of both discourses reaffirmed Susan negative attitude towards the discourse’s influence on beauty. This is explicitly seen with her paralinguistic such as the sucking of her teeth and laugh in line 64-65 associated with the discourses, as she refers to it as ‘fake’. Susan’s’ attitude towards the medias false perception of beauty aligns with Sinkman (2013) statement that ‘society is becoming increasingly concerned with mechanisms to obtain or improve beauty, such as beauty enhancements, body modiﬁcation.’ This is apparent within todays current concerns concerning surgeries such as Brazilian Butt Lifts to achieve the ‘ideal body type’, as statistics show that it is deadliest type of plastic surgery with 3000 cases of death. Through this statistic it reveals the social pressure as a discursive object to achieve the ideal perception of beauty.<nl>Moreover, it can also be discussed that social media such as Instagram is not the only outlet of media that produces pressure as a discursive object. Media outlets such as magazines can also present a discourse of pressure and damage about perception of beauty, this is explicit within criticism surrounds fashion magazines such as Vogue; as they were criticised for photoshopping their ‘cover to make plus-sized model look thinner’.<nl>Therefore, it can be concluded that Susan’s attitude towards these discourses holds a certain credibility about the rising concerns of beauty standards within today’s society.<nl><data_excerpt><nl>Susan recognises that the perception of beauty discussed for majority of the interview was Westernised perceptions of beauty and recognises the other cultural perceptions of beauty. <nl>This demonstrates beauty as an ethnocentric discursive object as within every culture what is perceived as beautiful to one may be perceived undesirable to another, in addition it also shows the equal weighing of environment playing an equal factor in perceptions of beauty in correspondence to media which is normally the first considered influenced on beauty.  <nl><nl>Discourse 5- Perceptions of beauty is never fixed <nl><data_excerpt><nl>Susan shows that the discourse of beauty is temporal, as throughout history what was concerned as beautiful changed this is apparent through eras in history such as Egyptian Beauty and Victorian Beauty. As Egyptian beauty included both male and females going to great lengths regarding appearance, consisting of dramatic dark eye makeup and wigs in contrast to the Victorian Era which involved a pale face and rosy cheeks. The vast difference in beauty amongst these two eras demonstrates the discourse of beauty being temporal.<nl>Susan appears to present that the discourse of beauty is not completely objective or subjective but in fact there is middle ground as the discursive objects such as culture, genre, era play a role in the objective aspect of standards of beauty. Alongside with the subjective aspect in relation to having a choice in what type of beauty an individual wants to adopt. <nl>Discussion<nl>Throughout the interview the discourses presented demonstrate the complexity of perceptions of beauty. This can be seen with the two opposing aspects concerning the discourse of outward appearance, as on one spectrum it is perceived as futile as it conveys an unrealistic beauty standard to obtain. whilst on the other spectrum outward beauty in relation to style is not frowned upon as it is perceived as beauty to aspire to, in relation to providing a guide on fashion. Furthermore, this interview also demonstrated the various influences on both an individual’s perception of beauty and societal construct concerning beauty which is contingent on music genre, history era and culture. Therefore, showing a grey area in having a perception of beauty as a ones percpetion of beauty cannot be completely right or wrong.<nl><nl>", "r <addr11_FN>,<nl><nl> <nl><nl>I have uploaded my sample onto <system>.<nl><nl> <nl><nl>Have you received it yet?

{"id": "82e78077-a911-475e-b1e3-a1b8d45b22f3", "discourse_types": ["essay", "text_message"], "pair": ["Introduction<nl>The non-binary gender movement is seen as a relatively new phenomenon due to increased activism in the years 2015 and 2016 (Richards, Bouman, &amp; Barker, 2017). Campaigning for awareness and inclusion by organisations such as the Non-Binary Inclusion Project has brought the conversation into mainstream society, however there is a longer supressed history. Consequently, there is very limited literature regarding non-binary individuals and the social attitudes towards them. Day and Nicholls’ (2019) produced a paper exploring attitudes of non-transgender students towards transgender people which induced interest in the presented research topic. As history has progressed, society has shown to become more accepting of people and ideas that lay outside the norm. However, statistics by YouGov show that 41% of trans people and 31% of non-binary people have experienced a hate crime in the last 12 months (YouGov, 2017). Therefore, research is needed to establish whether attitudes have truly changed.<nl><nl>The research question I was looking to investigate was \"What attitudes are present towards those who identify as non-binary?\". Key discourses to uncover include; what is considered normal with gender, the challenges non-binary people face and whether society is widely accepting of these individuals. This led to the development of the semi-structured interview schedule included as appendix 1. Looking at attitudes towards non-binary individuals meant a participant who was not non-binary could be selected. This facilitated discourse analysis and Willig’s 6-stage process was followed (Willig, 2008). Due to confidentiality reasons, the interviewee will be referred to as Anna.<nl><nl>Analysis<nl>Key discourses identified refer to the construction of \"others\", identification as a choice and the fluctuating permanence of societal views.<nl><nl>Construction of Others<nl>Anna used language in a way that constructed non-binary people as being separate others. Individuals were spoken about as if they were distinctly different to the interviewee, who identifies as a cisgender female, and to other members of society. This demonstrates the normalisation of identifying as your assigned sex at birth and the rejection of people who do not fit into the norm.<nl><data_extract><nl>The choice of wording being \"experienced something\" to describe non-binary identification almost has connotations of a religious or spiritual awakening. It seems to suggest that non-binary people have had an association with a higher power which had led them to think that they are more than male or female. As gender governs human lives, perhaps non-binary individuals are likened to being more than human. This comment is significant as it regards non-binary people in a higher respect than people who identify with just one gender. Even though they are considered to be others, this may be in a positive rather than negative light. The use of \"experience\" also assumes that non-binary individuals have not always felt this way and that something has occurred in order for this identification to proceed. This indicates a conscious choice, a discourse that will be explored further on.<nl>Despite the previous positive symbolism, Anna goes on to express the need for another category for non-binary people. She initially used the word \"definitely\", which has strong intentions, when explaining that this should be the case. This was retracted when repeating the end of the sentence suggesting that this was misspoke. This could indicate that this was her true opinion which may have then been altered in order to appear more socially acceptable and to fit in with the general consensus of a progressive society. This signifies that society as a whole may not be as complicit in ‘othering’ behaviour as Anna was herself.<nl><data_extract><nl>Again, Anna has added to the discourse of othering by the use of the phrase \"something else\" to refer to non-binary individuals. The choice of the word \"thing\" rather than person is dehumanising and creates a distance between her and non-binary individuals. Anna is no longer able to relate to the \"thing\" and an outgroup has been created. Social identity theory states that members of an ingroup believe that their ingroup is distinctive from and superior to the outgroup which then leads to discrimination against outgroups (Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1979). <nl>In this situation, non-binary individuals are considered to be inferior which aids prejudicial treatment.<nl><nl>In contrast to this, Anna uses the word \"we\" when saying \"we’re living in a free world\". Using this discursive tool places the interviewer, participant, non-binary and gender conforming individuals into the same societal group. This assumes that the free world is for everyone and the same privileges are received by all. She considers non-binary individuals to have the freedom to express themselves how they desire without persecution, which suggests a wider belief that society is permitting of people acting how they choose to. However, this does not indicate that negative attitudes have ceased, rather that people are just choosing to suppress verbal opinions.<nl><nl>Identification as a Choice<nl>Anna heavily drew upon discourses which presented non-binary identification as a conscious choice. Individuals were considered to have alternative experiences to those who identified with their assigned sex which led them towards their identification. This reveals how identifying with your biological sex is considered to be the default and other identifications are decision based.<nl><data_extract><nl>Anna has used the term \"believe\" once again when referring to non-binary people. Belief is an expression commonly used when declaring concepts that are intangible or that do not have a scientific basis, for example religion or mythical beings. Likening non-binary people’s existence to something that is either believed in or not indicates that their presence is not acknowledged by society as being authentic. By describing non-binary individuals in this way, it is extremely damaging to their sense of identity. Findings by Johnson et al. (2019) showed that invalidation in multiple social contexts contributed to negative affective and cognitive processes for non-binary adolescents which included confusion, self-doubt and internalised shame. This demonstrates that unconscious negative biases are held in society and these have detrimental effects for non-binary people.<nl><data_extract><nl>Anna used the phrase \"that’s become quite popular at the moment\" when talking about how people are identifying as non-binary. This is important as it does not denote permanence and likens this movement to a trend or a song. It suggests that people may decide to identify as non-binary while it is popular this year, but this phenomenon will be seen to disappear again as soon as it arrived. By using language in this way to create the discourse of choice, the experiences of non-binary people are invalidated. Their personal struggles with identity are minimised or even dismissed and struggles with stereotyping and bullying are disregarded.<nl><nl>Additionally, by using the word \"recently\" she does not acknowledge the rich and diverse history of non-binary identification and the consequences that derived from identifying in this way. This is due to a lack of knowledge and reflects the lack of queer education in society. A report from GLAAD found that increased knowledge about LGBT people led to lower levels of discomfort towards this community and reduced LBGT discrimination (GLAAD, 2014). This demonstrates that ignorance may be fuelling negative social attitudes and education could lead to a change.<nl><nl>Permanence of Societal Views<nl>Anna used language which implied varying degrees of permanence to current views. Some societal views were constructed as being temporary and some were constructed as being concrete and resistant to change. <nl><data_extract><nl>This quote was referring to the use of discrete categories for clothing in dress stores. By using the phrase \"it doesn’t have to be\" Anna acknowledges that there is room for improvement of societal attitudes. She suggests that if there was a large-scale change for example by a clothing company, then people would be relieved from the binary which would increase open-mindedness. This is juxtaposed by the phrase \"but it very much is\" which is contradicting to the original message. This implies that while there is the opportunity for enhancing the lives of others, there is a lack of drive. This negative outlook suggests that individuals in society are focused on keeping the superiority of their own ingroup, at the cost of the well-being of the non-binary out group.<nl><data_extract><nl>Anna used the phrase \"at the moment\" 5 times during the course of the interview. This was used when comparing non-binary activism to various social movements such as feminism, gender equality and Black Lives Matter. By using words such as \"minute\" and \"moment\", social movements are perceived to be current and short natured. This may show that years of activism go unnoticed by society if it does not benefit the majority. By constructing language in this way, Anna demonstrates how society is only able to comprehend one change at a time. Feminism is the sole focus and only when this is achieved, will non-binary issues take the forefront.<nl><nl>Anna also uses the word \"they\" when talking about equality. This choice of word removes responsibility from herself for actioning change. This suggests that only certain people hold this power, potentially only those in authority. This stance would explain why non-binary progression in society is slow as it reflects the belief that not everyone is in the position to make a difference. People either do not recognise that they could be valuable allies in fighting for queer rights, or they do not believe it is their place. By using language like this, Anna is recognising that non-binary individuals are not considered to have achieved equality in society. <nl><nl>To Conclude<nl>In deconstructing the language used by Anna to describe non-binary people, a main negative attitude prevailed which may be due to a lack of understanding. Discourses constructed non-binary individuals as being distinctly different to the interviewee and identifying this way by choice. Social attitudes were also constructed as having varying permanence. The inconsistencies uncovered reflect that there may be diverse social attitudes towards non-binary individuals.", "h babe that’s calm<new>Where did you park in town? x<new>n what time shall I meet you at your car xx<new>I’m back home from town now so I’ll have lunch and pack and then walk to <location> xx<new>Or get the train to <station> and walk there<new>okay so shall we say 5 or 5:30?

The high number of ASD children means that it is imperative to have correct measures in place when they are put through police interviewing. There are policies in place to support children under the age of 18 who classed as ‘vulnerable witnesses’ (impairment to intelligence and social functioning), by giving them assistance to provide the best evidence possible in court (Ministry of Justice, 2011). However, in our justice system there are still issues which need to be corrected, as current research shows that when a child is labelled with ‘autism’ the evidence they provide is questioned in credibility by jurors (Crane et al., 2018). <nl><nl>On top of this, the difficulties present in ASD children could significantly impact the information that is gathered by police, as they lack communication, social skills (Knott et al., 2006) and also impairments in memory (Bruck et al., 2007). There are two recommendations which will be examined to help police gather evidence in ASD children.<nl><nl>The standard cognitive interview includes four main techniques (Köhnken et al., 1999). Mental context reinstatement (MRC) is one segment of the interview that requires the person to go back in time to remember the emotions they felt and the physical environment around them (Maras &amp; Bowler, 2011). However, ASD children have impairments in their memory, specifically in their autonoetic consciousness (Gardiner, 2001), this therefore, means that they might find the process of MRC difficult. Evidence has shown this to be true as people with autism recalled fewer details in the MRC interview (Maras &amp; Bowler, 2010). This is especially relevant to ASD children, as they already tend to recall fewer details than typically developing (TD) children (Williams et al., 2006). Therefore, police need to find an appropriate way of aiding recall for ASD children as the MRC has shown to exacerbate their memory.<nl><nl>The inclusion of sketching as a form of context reinstatement (Sketch-RC) rather than the normal MRC before a free recall has been seen to be beneficial for ASD children in recall (Mattison et al., 2014). A study that delved further into this had used ASD children and TD children to watch a video (Mattison et al., 2018), and then had compared sketch-RC and MRC, following with a free recall afterward. A probed recall phase was also used to gain further detail, but it was entirely based on what the children had stated in their free recall. In this case, the findings supported the usage of sketch-RC in interviewing as ASD children recalled 25% more than the ASD children in the MRC condition. This could be explained by the encoding specificity theory (Tulving, 1972); which states that the ASD children recalled better because the cues were present in encoding and retrieving, so, the sketches helped facilitate these cues more than just mentally reinstating the context. <nl><nl>In contrast, Henry et al (2017) had conducted a similar study but additionally looked into ‘verbal labels’ and ‘registered intermediary’ interviews, there was no improvement in recall to the ASD children in the Sketch-RC or the other two interviews. This comes to question whether Sketch-RC does improve memory recall or were there methodological issues that caused the study to not find any significant results. This study did have its limitations, as Dando et al (2018) had brought this to light. Participants were aimlessly placed in either a live condition or a video condition, 83% of TD children and only 30% of ASD children were placed in the live condition. This could have impacted the significance of the results because ASD children are more perceptive of their surroundings, as they process sensory information around them differently (O’Neill and Jones, 1997), therefore the children could have encoded the information differently when streaming a video version rather than witnessing the live event, impacting the validity of the results. <nl>Even though there might be drawbacks to the article’s methodology to cause the results to not support sketch-RC, there are still several studies that reinforce the idea of how positive the sketch-RC can be in real life. For instance, a field study had looked into children’s accounts of sexual abuse. The use of drawing had significantly increased the amount of detail recalled, rather than just a standard interview (Katz &amp; Hershkowitz, 2009). With this in mind, sketch-RC has shown to be valuable in the real world as well as in just studies, so police should highly consider using this method to capture more information. <nl> <nl>The takeaway message is that the MRC in a cognitive interview might not be an appropriate measure to gather information from ASD children. So, the use of sketch-RC might be considered more appropriate than MRC when conducting a cognitive interview for ASD children, as it allows them to access memories using the contextual cues from their sketches. This will be fairly important in real life as each information given by the witness can help in finding the perpetrator or piecing the investigation together. <nl>Consequently, social interaction is vital in police interviewing, as it requires a verbal exchange of information. However, ASD children tend to lack the social skills to interact and confidently communicate to get their ideas across (Knott et al., 2006). The cognitive interview, therefore, might pose a problem, as ASD children will consider it socially demanding (Johnson, et al., 2018), which might cause them to become distressed and impact their retrieval of information (Quas &amp; Lench, 2007).<nl><nl>On account of this, the advancements in technology can allow police interviews to be conducted with robots rather than humans to minimise the distress (Wood et al., 2013). There have been significant benefits in the use of robots, as they have shown to improve the social skills of TD children (Robins et al., 2004; Aresti-Bartolome and Garcia-Zapirain 2014) and in ASD children (Wainer et al., 2010).<nl>The creation of ‘Kinesics and Synchronization in Personal Assistant Robotics’ (KASPAR) has shown to be beneficial to ASD children. An observational study had been conducted to see how children would react to the KASPAR with adults present (Robins et al., 2009). They had found that the ASD children interacted positively by smiling, touching, and gazing at the KASPAR. Also, an important finding they had found was that it helped facilitate social interactions with the co-present adult. This could be beneficial in police interviewing as it will help support the ASD child in feeling comfortable, but also can act as a social mediator for when ASD children are being interviewed. <nl><nl>Nevertheless, evidence has shown that the KASPAR does come with its challenges, as a study had found that children were scared of viewing the robot because of how it looked (Huijnen et al., 2018). This would undermine the use of KASPAR, as it would cause further distress and impacting the ASD child’s memory.<nl><nl>Opposed to this view, a reinforcing study by Wood et al (2013) had comparable results to Robins et al (2009) using the KASPAR. However, the study involved the children to be interviewed in a similar manner to a police interview, as they had used questions that would retrieve facts and not feelings from the children. The eye gaze and interview duration were much longer when the interviewer was a KASPAR rather than a human. This key finding links with ASD children as eye contact is a necessary part of communication (Nation and Penny., 2008). This adds support to the use of KASPAR in police interviews as it will help ASD children to feel at ease and help in memory recall; but also this study helps put in perspective how the use of a robot could help ASD children in a police setting. <nl>ASD children’s perception of the KASPAR allows us to understand why they feel more closer to robots than humans. They seem to identify them as toys (Peca et al., 2014) and neither a living nor non-living being (Kahn et al., 2012); suggesting that robots are seen as less intimidating than humans, which allows them to react to them in an anthropomorphic way. <nl><nl>However, with the recent addition of rapport-building in the cognitive interview, it can be argued that there might not be a need for the KASPAR. As the rapport-building phase has demonstrated to make children feel comfortable and confide to the interviewer considerably more (Hershkowitz, 2011). In opposition to this, the use of robots has seemed to show the same effects as the rapport-building phase, as a study had shown that children were more likely to share the secret to the robot than to the teacher after being prompted equally in both conditions (Bethel et al., 2011). Therefore, the use of a robot could be more beneficial and less time consuming when gaining information from a child.<nl><nl>In summary, the evidence above provides the KASPAR to accomplish what a human interviewer might not be able to in a cognitive interview. It suggests that the KASPAR can aid children in feeling relaxed, as this is important in salvaging memories of the witnessed event. But most importantly it can help the police interviewers by acting as a social mediator between the child and the interviewer. Police should therefore highly consider the use of a KASPAR for ASD children.<nl><nl>To conclude, both uses of a sketch-RC and a humanoid robot appear to support ASD children in memory. Sketch-RC is an improvement from the standard MRC as it visually helps ASD children to see the contextual cues. The KASPAR also helps benefit in the interaction of the ASD child and the interviewer, which in turn allows the child to feel at ease and not impede their memory. Both recommendations have a significant amount of evidence to support their use, yet there have been a few limitations which interferes in their validity of being useful. It should however still be considered in the use of police interviews.", "<nl><nl>That really helps, I’ll try take it on board when writing up the introduction !

Over the years, the concept has evolved from corporate philanthropy (Bowen, 1953) to incorporate broader concerns such as environment and human rights, driven by social rights and legislative change (Carroll and Shabana, 2010). In recent years, CSR has been viewed as a link between business strategy and sustainable development, causing companies to utilise industry standards such as the United Nations Development Goals and Global Compact. This pressure from stakeholders to go beyond the minimal requirements allows companies to address broader goals and objectives, and by doing so, a positive brand image is created (Carroll, 2016).<nl>Political influence can be defined as a \"social influence process in which behaviour is strategically designed to maximise short-term or long-term self-interest, which is either consistent with, or at the expense of other’s interests\" (Ferris, Russ and Fandt, 1989). Political CSR is described as activities where \"CSR has an intended or unintended political impact, or where intended or unintended political impacts on CSR exist\". Therefore, political CSR can be used in three ways, which will be analysed further; these include being used as a substitute for non-conventional forms of political activity or directly supporting conventional political activities such as lobbying and constituency building. Additionally, CSR can be used in a novel or innovative way which does not directly correspond to political activity (Frynas and Stephens, 2014). This assignment will evaluate research surrounding the relationship between CSR and political activity, analysing the three ways CSR has been utilised to advance corporations political standing concerning real-life cases.<nl>The reasons in which CSR can be strategically used generally concerns initiatives to build corporate brand image or reputation, constituency building, building relationships and even agenda setting whereby donations can reinforce key industry messages to shift perceptions (Fooks and Gilmore, 2013). In order to analyse the relationship between CSR and political influence, this report will be focusing heavily on the research surrounding Coca-Cola, British American Tobacco and oil and gas companies. However, it must be noted that there is a limitation of the research surrounding the relationship between CSR and political influence, as it primarily focuses on these industries.<nl>Industries surrounding public health and the environment has been seen to invest heavily in CSR operations to \"offset\" their negative brand image and gain political support due to operations that are seen as working directly against society’s benefit (Fooks and Gilmore, 2013). For-profit corporations have been increasingly promoting that they act as partners with government and communities to address social problems. These partnerships are what Coca-Cola’s former CEO refers to as \"connected capitalism\", in which collaborations help maximise shareholder value (Foster, 2014). In turn, by utilising constituency building, corporations can facilitate access to policy elites and build relationships with them. This relates to a global triangle, an approach to sustainability in which business, government, and civil society join. Coca-Cola’s CEO claims the partnership system Coca-Cola has developed is \"the most beautiful example\" of the golden triangle where each party can come together and make a difference to big societal problems (Radtke, 2013).  Although CSR sees an increasingly political role for business firms, corporations are analysed to \"step in\" using \"a global triangle\" to fill governance gaps which they present as governments failing to do so alone. This positioning to take on political responsibilities is seen as a way to present themselves as pursuing public interests whilst pursuing their own political interests whilst building relationships (Eberlein, 2019).<nl>CSR as a means of Constituency Building and Facilitating Access to Policy Elites<nl>Ha and Hoang (2020) discovered a positive relationship between corporate social responsibility and political risk, suggesting that firms are more likely to invest in CSR as an \"insurance mechanism\" against adverse political events. Corporations can utilise CSR to support conventional political activities through constituency-building strategies to establish relationships with key opinion leaders, policymakers, media, and community involvement. In turn, this attempts to influence public policy by gaining the support of voters and citizens, who in turn express their preferences to political decision-makers (Mialon et al., 2016) (Hillman and Hitt, 1999). Although constituency building is a relatively robust strategy, Rehbein and Schuler (2013) argue that it is hard for companies to implement effectively. This is due to the difficulties convincing societal groups to politically participate, showing the support of a corporation. Even if stakeholders were to participate, it is hard to guarantee their effectiveness (Mialon et al., 2016).<nl>Neu et al. (1998) discussed that firms expanding their efforts to manage their legitimacy forestalls regulatory activities by the state that might occur without these efforts. Therefore, utilising CSR as a method of constituency building can minimise the political, legislative changes that can broadly impact businesses due to the legitimisation effect. For example, Mialon et al. discovered that Coca-Cola in Australia heavily used constituency building strategies by using CSR to have relationships with health organisations, community groups and policymakers. More specifically, Coca-Cola developed an initiative to encourage physical activity for kids called \"The Happiness Cycle\", partnering with an Australian charity. This was also interpreted as an agenda-settingframing activity as the company promoted the initiative to \"curb obesity\" and emphasised that they wished to be \"part of the solution\" (Mialon et al., 2016).<nl>By using their reputation and influence in a region gained by their CSR initiatives, companies such as Coca-Cola can wield power in governmental organisations. This was present in India, where two members of FSSAI (Food Safety Standards Authority India) are affiliated with an organisation funded by Coca-Cola. This organisation has undermined public health policies by networking with nutrition sciences to nudge \"government policy into alignment with the company’s corporate interests\" (Greenhalgh, 2019). By employing CSR through community campaigns, corporations can gain a sense of \"legitimacy\" that forms a sense of trust, increasing the likelihood that constituency building will be effective and increase their political influence. Furthermore, enhancing legitimacy enables corporations to conduct business activities more effectively than firms that do not engage in community CSR activities and may help minimise risks such as shareholder activism, boycotts of products and negative media coverage (Mirvis, Googins and Rochlin, 2007).<nl>However, Mialon et al.’s research surrounding the food industry's corporate political activity can be criticised because it could only incorporate publicly available information. This means that the research is unlikely to give a complete picture of the practices adopted by the food industry, as there is a lack of public documentation surrounding political activity, such as lobbying policymakers and private interactions. Therefore, this questions the validity of their findings, and the specific details of how CSR industry practices influence political activity needs to have further investigation.<nl>Exploiting CSR politically to work with other influential groups creates the perception that the message a corporation wishes to convey is balanced and credible, adding to the benefits of using CSR as a means of constituency building (Friedman et al., 1994). Using statistical analysis, Navarro (1998) concluded that although a company’s philanthropic activities can enhance brand image, increasing the effectiveness of lobbying activities, there was no direct relationship found between CSR activities and policy outcomes. As suggested previously, only firms working against public welfare will be using CSR to gain political influence, such as those within public health and energy industries. Therefore, as Navarro’s study incorporated a range of firms from different industries, it was unlikely to find a correlation between CSR and political outcomes. <nl>CSR can be strategically utilised to meet stakeholder needs and improve a company’s competitiveness and profitability (Porter and Kramer, 2006). CSR can be used to gain a positive brand image to attract more customers with the increasing demand from stakeholders for companies to adopt socially responsible practices to create a more sustainable and equitable world. Not all CSR initiatives are used to gain political influence, but the benefits of a positive brand image indirectly can help firms gain political power through Constituency and Relationship Building.<nl>CSR as a means of Agenda Setting<nl>As mentioned previously, CSR is also used as an Agenda Setting method to produce political effects. Fooks discovered a close connection between agenda-setting and constituency building where donations were allocated by BAT to groups \"based on their potential to shape policy agenda through their influence on government thinking and news reporting\" (Fooks and Gilmore, 2013). Smoking tobacco is the leading cause of death, illness and impoverishment, killing more than 8 million people each year (WHO, 2020). However, despite this significant public health crisis, tobacco companies and other unhealthy commodities utilise CSR as a PR initiative to create the illusion that they are a \"changed\" company and operate with health interests (WHO, 2009). Research by Fooks et al. analyses that Philip Morris and British-American Tobacco (BAT) engages in CSR primarily due to the potential to promote policy outcomes that work against public welfare. Specifically to prevent the introduction of effective government regulation, which has a record of effectiveness in reducing tobacco consumption (Fooks et al., 2012). Utilising CSR as an Agenda Setting method has allowed BAT to make donations towards reinforcing industry messages designed to alter the discussion of tobacco control away from public health and more towards the economic impacts and employment opportunities the industry gives.<nl>Agenda setting aims to manipulate public awareness surrounding issues prevalent in an industry that directly correlates to Coca-Cola. Hamilton (2015) discovered that Coca-Cola’s press releases surrounding CSR have a language that exhibits a paternalistic mentality with words like \"serve,\" \"help,\" and \"provide\". This paternalistic activism contends that outsiders are not best equipped to solve social and environmental issues, therefore boosting the image of their importance. The corporation exhibits a \"power-over\" approach that analysed as robbing communities of the \"decision-making process that affect their lives\" (Ledwith and Springett, 2010). It is hard for the general population to gain back their political influence from corporations acting in a CSR positive way when considering the substantial disparity between communities and Coca-Cola’s access to resources, political decision-makers, and media outlets (Hamilton, 2015). <nl>Additionally, in Georgia, USA, the Coca-Cola foundation pledged $3.8m to tackle obesity with the public health agency, the CDC (Radtke, 2013). The Times reported that the money given to the CDC contributed towards a strategy of funding scientists \"who encouraged the public to focus on exercise and worry less about how calories contribute to obesity\" (Kaplan, 2017). Utilising this charitable CSR initiative can take the narrative away from their unhealthy sugar-filled drinks contributing to obesity. By presenting themselves alongside their CSR projects using paternalistic vocabulary to the media, Coca Cola can shape the public agenda and shift perceptions of the underlying adverse effects of their operations and impact on public health. <nl>Gómez (2019) found that three primary factors can limit Coca-Cola’s agenda-setting influence, which is likely to impact other corporations. First, the ability of industry lobbyists to meet with legislative members; second, the pre-existing ties a government has with a corporation and the interests they have in benefiting from the companies’ operations and finally; the corporation supported researchers and activist’s vs the public health advocates, which are divided on opinions. All three of these limiting factors can have risk reduced by CSR initiatives surrounding constituency building, building relationships, agenda-setting and improving brand image.<nl>CSR as a means to support lobbying activities<nl>Regarding lobbying to change the narrative, it is a practice whereby a company or organisation aims to influence government leaders to create legislation that will benefit their industry somehow. The oil and gas industry has been reported as the 6th highest lobbying spender in the United States in 2020 (Duffin, 2021). It is common practice for oil and gas companies to engage in \"greenwashing\" to appear more environmentally responsible (Cherry and Sneirson, 2011). Nasiritousi (2017) wrote about oil and gas companies and how their input and attendance at climate change conventions is controversial as one of the most significant contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. However, they portray themselves as lobbyists against climate change and fund organisations which discredit climate science. These corporations spend countless amounts of money to change the narrative, such as campaigns that convince consumers that their lifestyles must change, as also seen with Coca Cola previously. Campaigns promote that humans are the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases- prevaricating the possibility that they are the largest polluters. Showing that they are \"reactive\" to these issues and rebranding themselves as part of the solution to the climate crisis helps to minimise the chances of a significant policy change being implemented that will further impact their business (Cherry and Sneirson, 2011).<nl>The oil and gas industry can be analysed using Goffman’s (1959) self-presentation theory whereby activities are analysed by a \"front-stage\" of how companies present themselves sustainably and the \"back-stage\" which relates to their corporate political activities. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) bill has been a considerable controversy for the oil industry. It was designed to allow oil investigations to occur in sensitive environmental areas (Cho et al., 2016). Environmentalists and Indigenous communities disputed the ANWR bill due to the irreparable impact oil companies would have on their land. Cho et al. (2016) analysed how oil firms sustainability and CSR practices pressed on the importance of environmental care, ensuring that their CSR practices were visible. However, they kept their proactive political actions targeted towards their interests of passing the bill \"back-stage\". This is a form of impression management whereby firms push CSR practices to an audience to be perceived favourably, and these elements are what the firms are getting more attention for. This method of emphasising positives and underplaying the negatives of their intentions is a common component of sustainability reports whereby corporations will seek to demonstrate how their activities are aligned with social expectations (Goffman 1959; Collinson 1999; Cho et al., 2016).<nl>Corporate Reputation and Image<nl>In addition, Chen et al. (2007) discuss how US companies with worse product and safety infringements were more likely to give to charity than those with better records. They analyse how CSR can be used as a \"distracting technique\" which is an innovative method of gaining political influence without directly operating politically. Their findings suggest that corporate philanthropy is used more for legitimisation than a measure of CSR performance. Companies can legitimise operations by utilising creative philanthropic activities by rebranding their image to reshape public imagination or ideology (Chen et al., 2007). <nl>For example, trans-national corporations (TNC) are known for exploiting the environment in emerging market economies more commonly than developed economies. This is because TNC’s are likely to utilise the cheap labour and abundance of resources available in emerging market economies and exploit these for profit-maximisation purposes (Khanna, Palepu and Sinha, 2005). In order to minimise political changes such as increased taxes, emission permits and caps on natural resource use, companies can employ CSR initiatives to regions to improve the country’s infrastructure and social programmes, presenting themselves as a positive contributor to the region (Hohnen and Potts, 2007)<nl>In 2000, Coca-Cola established a plant in Kerala, India, where their bottling plant drew around 510,000 litres of water from open wells and boreholes. Non-governmental organisations (NGO’s) discovered that water table levels have decreased from 12m to 35m below the groundwater level. Local women and children had to walk nearly 5km twice a day to fetch water, although it was often unsuitable for drinking and bathing as the water burned their eyes and led to numerous skin conditions (Raj and Shaji, 2017). Additionally, harvest dropped by 40% due to the lack of irrigation, and Coca-Cola allowed toxic wastewater to flow into farmers’ fields near the bottling plants (Foy and Senker, 2012). Coca Cola has been documented to have numerous unethical violations worldwide, such as human rights violations in Columbia and environmental violations in India. <nl>However, The Coca-Cola Foundation has donated over $1 billion in contributions to enhance local communities’ sustainability, focusing on areas such as water conservation and recycling, economic empowerment for women, providing education, youth development, and other community and civic initiatives (Coca-Cola, n.d.). These donations are vital to governments that do not have the financial means to provide these services themselves, therefore relying on TNC’s heavily, which increases the power corporations hold in these regions (Willem te Velde, 2002). By positioning themselves as intensely involved in water conservation and community products, unethical behaviour is more likely to be overlooked, and instead, stakeholders will focus on the positive efforts made (Johnston, Amaeshi, Adegbite and Osuji, 2019). So, by engaging in CSR practices, incorporating business initiatives that benefit society, Coca Cola can uphold its positive image as a family-focused brand whilst minimising chances of political penalties on operations.<nl>Although the theory of using CSR as a method of distraction which Chen et al. (2007) discusses, was a strongly developed argument that companies with worse environmental and product safety history were more likely to give to charity than those with better operational history had some limitations to consider. The research focused on the pattern of charitable donations as purely a distraction technique, ignoring the discussion on the other reasons and effects of the patterns of charitable giving such as political CSR. Despite this, the research mentioned above shows a pattern of CSR encouraging bad behaviour to more likely be overlooked and instead, stakeholders will focus on the positive efforts made (Johnston, Amaeshi, Adegbite and Osuji, 2019). So even though CSR can be used as a distracting technique per se, the charitable contributions produce a legitimisation effect, which can help with political activities such as lobbying, access to policy elites, and constituency building due to the increased positive brand image.<nl>Final Analysis to Conclude<nl>It is without a doubt that there is a strong relationship between corporate social responsibility and political influence from the research provided above. However, as expressed previously, different industries are likely to use political CSR in vastly alternative ways, leading this topic to be challenging to analyse. Most research surrounds public health and environmental corporations that produce negative externalities to society. Therefore, even though the research utilised shows the strengths in the relationship, it cannot be entirely reliable and applied to all industries.<nl>The research provided in this paper suggests that there is a relationship whereby CSR is used as an insurance mechanism against political risks, insinuating that corporations are likely to increase CSR activities when the political environment is uncertain. Without a doubt, industries working against the public’s welfare have benefitted from using CSR as a means to gain political influence, as seen with the oil and gas industries \"greenwashing\" activities, Coca-Cola’s constituency building and BAT’s donations to shape policy agenda. Additionally, improving brand image has been seen to help corporations legitimise operations to shape the views of the public and policy setters by forming a sense of trust.<nl>In order to identify the true relationship between corporate social responsibility and political influence, it would be necessary to expand research in a broader range of industries. The available research displays a pattern between increasing CSR practises when operational activities are not in the public interests. Therefore, it can be concluded that there is a strong relationship between CSR and political activities, at least in the industries concerning public health and energy, or involving questionable product safety. If this were applied to industries that do not primarily work against public welfare, there would be a weaker relationship between CSR and political influence.", "<nl><nl> <nl><nl>I have just emailed over the required documents and also uploaded them to <system1>.

{"id": "f5972c9e-da66-463f-9b3a-ee263200ad7f", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Executive summary <nl>The following portfolio applies the six-sigma principle (Define, Measure, Analyse, Improve and control) to ASOS plc. The report begins by identifying which are the most important customer needs by drawing Critical to quality trees and using them to create metrics by which such needs can be identified. The mid-section of the report measures how well ASOS have met the needs expected by its customers and analyses and addresses the core issues behind this using methods such as the 5 why’s and affinity diagrams which aid in drawing out what the overall problem is and areas for improvement. The final sections of the report focus on addressing and eliminating issues by employing the 5’s and process mapping. Lastly overall recommendations are made for ASOS. Please find all relevant diagrams and documents in the Appendix at the end of the text. <nl>Introduction and Background <nl>The company that I have chosen to investigate is A.S.O.S. (Abbreviated for ‘As Seen on screen’) They are an online fashion and cosmetics retailer, founded in the year 2000 and based in the UK, London. 20 years later, the company now ship their products to 195 countries worldwide and sell over 850 brands on their site, alongside their own range of clothing and accessories. The company employs over 40, 000 s people as a part of this global operation. I chose to look at ASOS because they are a company, I have personal experience as a customer with, as well as knowing other people who have shopped with them also. I also thought it would be interesting to look at a business that operates solely online as this is the future of a lot of commercial activity. <nl>DEFINE (Value Added Case) <nl>The CTQ trees (figure 1) detail what needs are important to me as a customer at ASOS. The needs I identified were; good customer service, quality products and a high-quality website. Good customer service is important to me as there is not a physical store whereby, I can interact with the staff face-to-face or be persuaded by the physical environment to continue returning. Therefore, I can say that the integrity of the brand to me as a customer is dependent to on how well its customer service performs. If an order is not processed correctly, I expect customer services to fix the problem in order for me to decide to purchase from them again. These needs are further established by the following quality drivers; time taken to receive my order and how quickly a response is provided to my enquiries. Again, since the transaction happens online, as a customer I deem the brand more trustworthy if I have a positive experience of my product or <nl>refund consistently received quickly, and communication isn’t slow. This is reassuring to me and suggests that they care about my experience as a customer. I would further break these quality drivers into measurable metrics seen in figure that uphold ASOS to a high standard. If these metrics are followed, ASOS should be able to successfully provide good customer service. <nl>MEASURE (SERVQUAL) <nl>I asked 5 customers to complete a SERVQUAL questionnaire regarding the RATER aspects of ASOS (Basu, 2000), including aspects of the service which are tangible (i.e. clothes and accessories) and intangible (i.e. delivery and refunds). The results of the questionnaire are represented in figure 2, which outline the gap between ASOS ’customer expectations and actual perceptions once they have experienced the service and products. According to my results the areas which ASOS need the most improvement are empathy and assurance as they both fall below customer’s expectations of an ‘excellent online retailer.’ However, the graph shows responsiveness to have low expectations (in comparison to other areas) as well as perceptions. This is significant as I identified responsiveness as quality driver in the CTQ diagram. Although, this also suggests an opportunity for ASOS to be competitive as customers do not have as high an expectation for online retailers to be very responsive based on their past experiences. If ASOS implement this in the next stages of their six-sigma process they may have found a way to increase their competitiveness. The results also highlighted that in both Tangibles and Reliability customer expectations were exceeded, therefore ASOS can be said to have a high-quality performance in these areas. <nl>MEASURE (Cause and Effect Case) <nl>After considering the results of the SERVQUAL questionnaire and the needs highlighted in the CTQ diagram. I have chosen to analyse the causes behind two areas; Slow responses, which was the lowest scoring activity on the questionnaire and a lack of range in sizes as I have friends who have had issues with this when shopping from online retailers such as ASOS. In the diagram (figure 3) I have thought of potential causes for these issues; in order to identify ways to fix the core problems and thus improve the customer experience. Of the causes that I have identified, the most important to me as a customer are the fact that staff are uncertain of how to respond to emails. This is significant because if staff are unsure of how to respond then my query may not get answered quickly or with a response that is unsatisfactory or doesn’t adress what I am asking. The other significant cause is ASOS being slow to re- <nl>stock. This is undesirable as ASOS are a fast fashion retailer, not being able to meet this expectation, defeats the purpose of their business model and would make me look to other retailers in the market. <nl>ANALYSE (5 Why’s and Affinity) <nl>In the next stage of my research I created a flowchart asking the question ‘why?’ five times to further analyse the issue and conclude a root cause. From this exercise and use of an affinity diagram (figure 5), I identified and was able to group that the root causes were management related. There were internal issues regarding staffing, recruitment, training and time management that could be the cause of difficulties in responding to customer quieres and being slow to re-stock orders. To summarise, ASOS, like other companies in the same industry, often experience high turnover and sometimes can be slow to recruit new people in efforts to try and improve their retention level. ASOS could recruit internally if staff training was prioritised, thus giving staff the confidence to take on management roles when they become newly available. Overall, these issues fall under the responsibility of the Human resources department. With this information I will begin generating some potential solutions to improve the efficiency of the human resources at ASOS. <nl>IMPROVE (6 Hats and 5 S’s) <nl>Following the previous analysis stages, I thought of some plausible solutions to the HR issues that are potentially affecting the level of customer service at ASOS. I adopted the six-hat tool to analyse my options. The best solution I thought of was to outsource training for the marketing staff, primarily those that deal with customer service; however, it is important that all staff in this department have the same training to support each other where short-staffed. The goal of outsourced training would be to instil the confidence of staff and introduce methods of working that improve efficiency, without placing burden on the management staff. Wearing the black hat, (the most powerful), highlighted that ASOS have to be financially able to undertake this and consider which budget this will come from. I also considered whether training would actually make a significant impact or not, using the green hat in response, I decided that specific staff could be asked to undertake the training, if they find the training successful then the training could be extended to more departments. The Six sigma principle ‘standardise’ can also be applied here by creating posters or handbooks that can be placed around the office as a quick guide to responding to frequent enquiries, leaving time to respond more carefully to more complex enquiries. Circling back to the green hat, a <nl>computer program could be internally developed that scans emails for key words, listing these as quick enquiries to respond to. Above all ASOS should make it a priority to highlight customer service excellence in their company statement to encourage staff internalising these values. \"To win in services, a firm must develop a passion for service quality within the entire workforce.\" (Foster S. Thomas, 2016) <nl>IMPROVE (PDCA) <nl>At this stage the PDCA tool (Basu, 2000) As mentioned in the previous stage, the solution to the lack of training problem would be to outsource training. Therefore, the pilot study would be testing whether outsourced training will improve the efficiency of staff so that they can respond to emails faster. This will be done by giving staff and management a questionnaire that details the task they are least efficient in before training and another after the training to measure improvement. If a significant improvement is seen (large difference between before and after training scores), more employees across the organisation could also undertake the training. One of the considerable risks with the study is the financial ability of ASOS to support the training. In this case, I have chosen this method because it is easily scalable and will not cost much in the beginning but affords all departments time to plan and budget for this opportunity. The RACI chart (figure 7) shows that there is a shared responsibility between the human resources and managers to communicate internally and the responsibility of the training agency to provide a good service. It is also important that human resources consult marketing managers about which staff should undergo the training and make sure that they are informed. There is also accountability on the part of the staff to gain as much as they can from the training as it is primarily for their benefit. <nl>IMPROVE (Process Mapping) <nl>Six sigma process mapping is an effective tool for documenting a series of necessary steps and display of the value stream so that each step can be analysed for value creation (Quality improvement tools, 2018). Documenting process maps before and after changes (figures 8 and 9) highlights where value was created for ASOS’ customer service team. In this case the value created is in the staff training although visually the difference is not vast it demonstrates the effects of training mentioned in the previous section. Staff before training were more likely to ask management and seek approval for their responses, delaying the time customers received an answer, resulting in unsatisfied customers who do not return. <nl>Recommendations <nl>Another useful recommendations I would offer to ASOS would be to continuously update their FAQ (frequently asked questions) section.

{"id": "b652188a-c861-4e55-b770-a360edb88758", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["The question to what extent to which English Laws general hostility towards good faith in commercial contracts is justifiable within the modern day has been subjected to disapproval by some judges. In Interfoto Picture Library Ltd v Stiletto Visual Programmes Ltd Bingham L.J. noted that ‘in many legal systems outside the common law world, the law of obligations recognises and enforces an overriding principle that in making and carrying out contracts parties should act in good faith’ but English law has decided not to adopt a good faith obligation but rather ‘developed piecemeal solutions in response to demonstrated problems of unfairness.’ The courts in England are more concerned with commercial certainty rather than parties being just towards one another. <nl><nl>This essay will argue that the hostility towards good faith obligations within commercial contracts cannot be justified in the modern day and that there should be a good faith principle introduced in English Law. It will begin by discussing the current law in relation to good faith and explain how an overriding principle of good faith will be beneficial to the parties in commercial contracts. It will then suggest the reasons why in this day and age it is important for there to be an obligation of good faith within commercial contracts and give examples of the English law’s current recognition of implied and express good faith obligations. Finally, it will look at the general principles of the UK courts such as party autonomy and commercial certainty and explore how they can still be preserved with an obligation of good faith. <nl><nl>Good faith is the notion that those within contracts will act fairly towards one another. They will ‘put all their cards face upwards on the table’ and trade in a way that is open and fair.<nl>Traditionally good faith is not an overriding principle in English Law as the courts prefer for there to be certainty within commercial contracts as opposed to fairness. They are particularly against imposing broad good faith obligations. The reasons for this include the fact that it can cause uncertainty because if there was an obligation to act in good faith this can sometimes go against what the terms of the contract include. The parties can usually only go to court if one party does not fulfil their end of the contract. Furthermore, good faith can be seen as subjective as every person will have a different view of what good faith is and sometimes one judge may go too far and start siding with one party which would cause the other party a loss and so it would be difficult to find a middle point where it is suitable for both parties to not be at a complete loss. Another reason as to why the English courts prefer not to have a good faith obligation is because it makes them a lot more attractive to global businesses since they are one of the main countries without a good faith obligation. This allows for those wanting to get into commercial contracts to be more certain about the outcomes if anything was to go wrong. English law also prefers for there to be party autonomy as it allows both parties to be able to choose which law will govern their contract.  This allows for an enhanced level of certainty and predictability because both parties will be able to choose which laws best suit them. The parties also have freedom of contract which gives each party the freedom to enter into a contract and decide what terms to include. <nl><nl>Rather than an actual good faith principal English law prefers to adopt piecemeal solutions which are used for certain situations where it is seen as necessary. These will usually arise in fiduciary relationships, contracts of insurance and contracts of partnerships and employment. These include contractual interpretation where the courts will look at the intention of the parties rather than a strict interpretation of the words used in the contract.  Another instance where the courts might decide to use piecemeal solutions is when an unfair act amounts to promissory estoppel. Misrepresentation is another example where the courts might use piecemeal solutions. In some contracts such as ones where fiduciary duties are assumed there is a duty to consider the other party’s interests. The party assuming the fiduciary duties will be obligated to not act dishonestly and cannot allow their interests to clash with those of their principle.  <nl><nl>Within the terms of a contract a party is allowed to include an express term to act or negotiate in good faith. This will mean both parties will have to act and negotiate in good faith and the courts will uphold this term as it is written in the contract if it is breached by either party. In Berkeley Community Villages Ltd v Pullen, it was held that an agreement would be enough to create a contractual obligation for the parties to act in good faith. This approach was also used in CPC Group Ltd v Qatari Diar Real Estate Investment Co by Vos J. who stated that ‘the obligation of utmost good faith in the [contract]was to adhere to the spirit of the contract …. And to observe reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing, in the shortest possible time, and to be faithful to the agreed common purpose, and to act consistently with the justified expectations of the parties.’ There is an increased amount of recognition for express terms to act in good faith in commercial contracts and many judges will uphold the term because their concern is ensuring the terms of the contract are not breached. This means that if a party wants a good faith obligation in their contract then they just have to include one as a term of the contract but if the other party does not want a goof faith obligation imposed on them then it can cause some issues for the parties as it could be assumed that the other party may not have the intention to act fairly and that is the reason why they don’t want a good faith obligation in the contract. However, if there was a good faith obligation then this would ensure that both the parties have to act fairly towards one another which would almost eliminate the party’s having bad intentions entering the contract as they know if they act upon their bad intentions then they will have to face the consequences in court. In the past there has been attempts by judges to introduce a good faith principle that extends to all contracts. In 1766 Lord Mansfield declared that ‘[t]he governing principle is applicable to all contracts and dealings. Good faith forbids either party by concealing what he privately knows, to draw the other into a bargain, from his ignorance of that fact, and his believing the contrary. But either party may be innocently silent, as to grounds open to both, to exercise their judgment upon.’ However this outlook did not last long as the courts favoured party autonomy and sanctity of contract more.  It is useful for parties to have an express term to act in good faith in their contract as it would allow them to resolve a problem that might happen in the future using a good faith mechanism rather than use an expensive third-party tool. Having an express term to negotiate or act in good faith will allow parties to plan ahead in the event of an uncontrollable event happening such as the market crashing or an economic recession. In the event this does happen the parties will be able to discuss how they can continue to keep working with each other and how they will uphold their side of the agreement. It is becoming very common to find good faith clauses within contracts in the modern day which suggests that many people want to trade in good faith and would not be opposed to a good faith obligation as a lot of those in commercial contracts have willingly decided to include a good faith clause in their contracts. <nl><nl>Good faith may sometimes be implied by law in certain contracts as a term that must be followed. It is often needed in order for the contract to run smoothly. It is not implied based upon the intentions of the parties, rather because of the contractual relationship between the two parties.The different types of contracts it can be implied in include employment contracts, contracts of sale and goodwill as well as partnerships and contracts with fiduciary duties. Another way good faith can be implied is through fact. This is done to give importance to the intention of the parties in the contract. It is often implied based on necessity and obviousness. The case of Yam Seng Pte v International Trade Corp Ltd was significant in discussing whether there was an implied obligation that both parties will act in good faith with each other. Lord Leggart J. had agreed that the terms in the contract were enough to imply good faith and he also argued in favour of ‘the implication of a term requiring good faith in performance’ not only in just relational contracts but most commercial contracts based on the expectations of both parties. The fact that English law already has many instances where it uses pockets of good faith proves that a good faith principle would prove to be useful for parties entering into a contract as it is already used in several types of contracts and contractual relations. Many other countries such as the United States of America, Canada and Australia have a good faith principle in place which means that it is possible for the United Kingdom to have one too without the worry of wondering how they will execute such a principle. Although, the English courts might argue that having an obligation of good faith will take away from the party’s freedom of contract and party autonomy, this can be disputed with the fact that the Canadian Supreme Court has said ‘the principle of good faith must be applied in a manner that is consistent with the fundamental commitments of the common law of contract which generally places great weight on the freedom of contracting parties to pursue their individual self-interest.’ The English courts can follow a similar approach and apply the principle in a way that will still allow those in commercial contracts their contractual freedom whilst also ensuring that they deal in a way that is honest, fair and truthful to the other party. <nl><nl>The introduction of a good faith obligation will allow parties to feel more reassured that if the other party was to act in bad faith towards them, then they will at least have support from the courts. The party who acted in bad faith would be required to give compensation to the other party in order to correct their wrongdoings. The English courts are already accepting of a good faith clause within contracts and also state that there is a duty to act in good faith in certain types of relationships. This suggests that they may be open to the idea of introducing a legally binding principle of good faith. The law has developed in regard to express terms to negotiate in good faith since the case of Walford v Miles where the House of Lords had stated that promises to negotiate or not sell were unenforceable and rejected that the opposing party were under an obligation to act in good faith. Lord Acknew has stated that ‘a bare agreement to negotiate was not enforceable, as it lacked the necessary certainty.  It was no more than an (unenforceable) ‘agreement to agree’. However, in Petromec Inc v Petroleo Brasileiro SA Petrobras it was held that if there was an express term to negotiate in good faith then it is enforceable. Whilst Longmore LJ had expressed that there were three objections to negotiate in good faith, he also stated that these objections did not completely prevent enforceability. He claimed that the first objection had carried little weight because normally the express obligation would have been enforceable. The second objection would be difficult to determine as it is unlikely the courts will be able to decide when the breach of the term had amounted to good faith and unless fraud was involved then it is likely the court would not consider the other party had acted in bad faith. In regard to the third objection Longmore LJ stated it would be difficult to find out exactly how much loss had occurred as a result of the breach. The development in the law after both of these cases suggests that judges are more accepting of good faith clauses and they are not seen as unenforceable ‘agreements to agree’. The general view of judges in recent times agree with Longmore LJ and believe it would be ‘quite wrong’ for the courts to deem an express clause to negotiate in good faith as unenforceable. <nl><nl>It can be argued that introducing a good faith principle will undermine party autonomy and freedom of contract, but this can be easily resolved by using a method of enforcement similar to Canada when it comes to good faith. If the English courts enforce good faith, then they should limit the amount they get involved in order to preserve the freedom of parties. If the courts introduce a good faith clause then it should be ‘capable of being given legal content’. A good faith obligation would lead to fair dealing and less attempts of people acting in bad faith towards others. It would allow for more trust between parties as they will have more hope that it is unlikely the other party will act unfairly and unjustly towards them. <nl><nl>In conclusion there should be a good faith principle introduced in English law as it will reassure those entering commercial contracts that if they were to enter a contract then the other party will have to act towards them in good faith and trade fairly with them. Parties can also be reassured that the courts would help them if the other party acted in bad faith towards them. There is also an increase in the amount of people in commercial contracts including clauses to act or negotiate in good faith towards one another. This proves that many people are going out of their way to include these clauses as it can be seen as a form of protection. Many international courts have a good faith obligation in place, and it does not take away from the freedom parties have, rather it enhances their security and lessens the chances of them being scammed. This is because the other party will less likely want to act in bad faith if they know the implications of their actions if taken to court. Whilst it is likely the courts will have some reservations or concerns towards a good faith obligation; they can look at how international courts implement the obligation. This will help them to keep a balance between doing too much or too little whilst maintaining the general principles of English commercial law.", "<nl><nl>Thank you for your email.

The data was rectified in order to turn the negative values into positive so that the average signal strength (µV) was shown rather than the range. The data was averaged over 50 samples using Biopac’s ‘Integrate’ feature which allowed for the graph curves to be smoother and clearer. The rectification and integration of the data was necessary so that an accurate mean could be taken for each condition. These new rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA) were used for the rest of the data analysis. <nl><nl>Descriptive &amp; inferential statistics<nl>Table 1.<nl><table><nl>Table 1 shows that the mean of the eyes open condition was lower than the eyes closed condition. There was not a large amount of variance of data across the means (see Table 1). The eyes open condition had a smaller variance than the eyes closed, as the standard deviation was closer to the mean in this condition. The Chi² test suggests that the frequencies of the RAAA are significantly different in the eyes open and closed conditions (Chi² = 12.500, df = 1, p &lt; .01). The RAAA frequency was 26 in the eyes closed condition and 6 in the eyes open condition, so the means are consistent with the RAAA frequencies. <nl><nl>To summarise, the results show that there is a difference between the RAAA frequencies of the eyes open and eyes closed conditions.

As a group, we found the placement of the electrodes using the international 1020 positioning system fairly difficult, as it wasn’t particularly clear where exactly to place them on the scalp. We had to change the positioning of the electrodes and remove the dead skin from the scalp a few times until the impedance was low enough to continue the rest of the experiment. I didn’t enjoy placing the electrodes on the participant’s scalp and measuring the distance between the nasion and the inion because both tasks were meticulous and required a lot of patience. However, I did enjoy using Biopac to rectify the data in order to see clearly the brainwaves of the participant and how it correlated with whether their eyes were open or closed. In order to improve the experiment, I would reduce the number of confounding variables by ensuring the participant wasn’t blinking, talking or chewing during the experiment, as these artifacts may have had an impact on the data used for analysis. Additionally, I would have ensured the experiment took part in a quiet room away from other people as it is more likely for the brainwave activity to be due to whether the participant’s eyes were open or closed rather than distractions.<nl>", "lo,<nl><nl> <nl><nl>I am a Second year <course> student at <university>.

Firstly, I shortlisted Hotel: Marksi By Scandic which is based in the Helsinki city centre. I have selected the Classic Double room package which costs £157 per night. This package includes free breakfast which will be delivered to my CEO at her room, which means she need not travel out to a café. This package also contains a free re-booking policy which is very good in case she needs to change her booking due to COVID and can do so without worrying about paying extra money. Secondly, in case my CEO wanted to travel to a café to eat breakfast, I have selected the Fazer Café Kluuvikatu 3, café which is also based in the city centre and offers breakfast. It is rated 4-5 stars which is a good option. A restaurant i shortlisted was: Rosemariini, this includes vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes which is good for diversity of food and options. It offers different payment methods but currently offers a take away service. the Second restaurant i chose which is better than the first option is: Lappi Ravintola. this is a traditional restaurant with 4-5 star ratings and offers a 4 course meal, table booking and different payment methods i strongly recommend my CEO to visit this restaurant. Thirdly, the souvenir shop i have chosen for my CEO to visit is called: Moomin Shop Forum. This is based in the city centre and has received 4-5 star ratings from TripAdvisor. This gift shop contains gifts such as books, toys, cups and clothes which is highly ideal and beneficial for my CEO to buy gifts for herself and children as they may like books and toys. This gift shop is also based in international Helsinki airport as well as all over Helsinki so is easily accessible to visit. Finally, I have selected Helsinki City Museum to visit, as this is based in the city centre, not too far from the hotel. This also includes online exhibitions which is beneficial in case COVID was to increase in September and my CEO would be left with nothing to do, if this did happen then my CEO could attend online exhibitions too. Furthermore, i found a live music bar for my CEO to visit, called Storyville, Helsinki. this offers food, alongside live music band, piano room and dance floor which seems very entertaining.", "r <addr5_FN>,<nl><nl> <nl><nl>Thank you for your email.<nl><nl> <nl><nl>Yes I have re-submitted like you have requested me to.

Hence, I created my own formula called IPROG technique.<nl><nl> <nl><nl>I = introduction of the role I was in, P = problem I faced, R = resolving steps I took, O = outcome and G = going forward the things I have learned from the experience and how I will apply these to the job I am applying for.<nl><nl> <nl><nl>After adapting my IPROG technique I was becoming successful with my applications and this was how I passed my first ever interview with <organisation>.<nl><nl> <nl><nl>Secondly, I feel my success from my interview stems in how I was able to speak confidently and also display my personality through being pleasant and building an initial rapport with the interviewing panel at the start of my interview and at the end when I had the opportunity to ask them questions. I therefore think it’s a really good thing to display your personality because often employers don’t just want to employ a person who looks good on paper with high grades but also someone who is friendly, easy to talk to as this reflects the ability to work well with others and build a friendly working atmosphere.<nl><nl> <nl><nl>Thirdly, for me the whole process of constantly applying for jobs within <organisation> has been very rewarding. Overtime, I have began to understand what exactly employers are looking for and have been able to directly link my experience back to the job I am applying for both in my interview and applications. The process has allowed for new career-related doors to open for me especially at the right time too because looking back I wouldn’t have been able to work for <organisation> during university.<nl><nl> <nl><nl>Finally, I 100% believe that the events, programmes and opportunities I have been involved with at <university> during my academic career has proven to be very fruitful as this was how I was able to pass my interview despite not having an actual job to prove my team work, leadership, delivering at pace and many more skills and experiences. I am therefore very grateful to <university> to have developed such opportunities for students like myself to get involved with and become employable. I don’t think the positives of these events are mentioned enough and I think students should be more encouraged and open into being involved in such events and programmes as they can also learn valuable employability skills too especially during COVID-19.<nl><nl> <nl><nl>Apologies for my lengthy email!

{"id": "90eb16c7-1153-47c1-979e-be2247631cde", "discourse_types": ["essay", "memo"], "pair": ["Rationale: <nl>March 2020 when universities, schools, jobs, and lifestyle was put on hold for a four-month national lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Impact of COVID-19 on the populations mental health has been major. The lockdown meant people had to stay home and isolate from loved ones and family members. This led to people experiencing anxiety and depression as they could not go out and enjoy their social life (Cao et al., 2020). The action orientated analysis aims to derive the importance of investigating potential discourses surrounding the topic of COVID-19 impact on student’s mental health. Discourse analysis is based upon a semi structured interview collecting qualitative data (Smith., 1995) and focused on the research question, students’ attitudes towards the impact of COVID-19 on mental health. The interview schedule in the appendices shows the formation of this question and constructs potential discourses such as mental health, students’ lives, and future impact. Discourse analysis was chosen as the appropriate form of analysis for this investigation in order to gain a deeper understanding of the ways in which students discuss and express their attitudes on COVID impact on mental health and how powerful this subject matter is in today’s society. Willig (2015) showed how discourse analysis is suitable for a range of topics in order to assess the language, thus why it is appropriate for this topic. For confidentiality, the interviewee will be referred to by the pseudonym Ellie in this analysis.<nl><nl>Results:<nl>Discourse 1- ‘loneliness is killing us’.<nl>Ellie understands the mental impact COVID-19 has had on the general population. This is shown when she describes some experiences faced during the pandemic. In this extract Ellie explains how mental health has been a huge topic of conversation during the pandemic.<nl><data_extract><nl>Ellie suggests that due to lockdown many people’s health and mental wellbeing has been affected as they have been stuck indoors for many months with hardly any social interaction or without seeing any family members. \"organisations have signposted mental health really well\" (line 30-31) suggesting that other businesses have done a better job than the government has done in helping mental health. She also touches upon the fact that people in care homes have had it rough as for many months they have not seen their loved ones leading to loneliness and further mental damage. The discourse of mental health shows what impact COVID-19 has had on many lives in today’s society. Ellie suggests that many people in the future may face social anxiety as they have been stuck indoors with no other social interaction heading to increased social anxiety when meeting people again or not knowing how to interact anymore. This portrays that Ellie knows what is going on around her and is aware of the mental hardship many are facing during these unforeseen circumstances, however she feels as though she does not know what to do to help others.<nl><data_extract><nl>Ellie develops this discourse as a lack of social interaction the older generation has faced during this pandemic has had a mental and physical impact on many peoples lives. She suggests that due to the pandemic people are stuck indoors and many cant visit relatives in care homes or their houses as its dangerous causing \"isolation and loneliness\" (line 13). Ellie also mentions that many people may have loved ones in care homes who they cannot go and visit or may have to see them from a distance. This suggests that Ellie is worried about how families would cope with not seeing loved ones for so many months and how the deadly disease of Alzheimer’s and dementia can play a huge role during this pandemic. Ellies use of language and expression shows how worried she is for many families in this situation especially at these uncertain times.<nl>Discourse 2- ‘Students trapped indoors’. <nl>The impact of COVID-19 on students has been a running discourse throughout the whole interview. \"students feel like they are trapped indoors they cannot live like a student’s\". portrays the anger Ellie feels when it comes to her views on the impact of the pandemic on university students, as Ellie herself is a first-year university student, she has many strong views on this discourse.<nl><data_extract><nl>Here Ellie explains the impact of COVID-19 on students’ lives. She explains how university social life is non-existent as students cannot \"mix with other households\" this can be inferred as social isolation as Ellie feels like she cannot go out and meet others away from her flat she feels trapped with the same people every day who may not share same interests as her course mates who she cannot meet. This discourse shows Ellies frustration of being kept indoors and locked down from having fun and also enjoying what is meant to be university lifestyle. She feels as though her \"nightlife has been diminished\" (line 40) suggesting a growing concern of social isolation and not able to enjoy their prime childhood. Many goes on to explain how many students have moved to different parts of the country for university without their parents or loved ones and then thrown into social isolation. This can be traumatising for students at such a young age adding to loneliness and many other mental health problems. You can infer from Ellies speech that she is not happy with the handling of the pandemic for university students as they have no support from the government and are left to survive by themselves (lines 28-32). <nl><data_extract><nl>Ellie explains how many students are affected in schools. With the lockdown in March many schools were closed therefore students were at home for many months without having any homework or learning. Ellie spoke about how children \"lost interest and concentration\" and \"struggled fitting into school\" showing that she empathises with pupils as education is the most important at this age in order to build a strong future. She goes on to explain how children could not see their friends or teachers who may be their support and their happiness leading to loneliness and scared to go back to school as they have a loss in routine (70-73). From this we can infer that children at schools miss the social life of talking to their friends and having that support network as are too young to understand the implications of this pandemic, they just want to enjoy with their friends. This can induce loneliness and social boredom which is not great at such a young age.<nl><data_extract><nl>Ellie develops this discourse of acknowledging the fact that students may be disadvantaged in the job industry as many students are on cheap labour and are working parttime for minimum wage. This means that students are more likely to be made redundant as firms may not be able to afford to keep them on during this pandemic. Ellie recognises the harsh impact of students losing their jobs can have an impact on their mental health as the stress and anxiety of not being able to work to afford rent or their lifestyle can be a huge impact. <nl>Discourse 3- ‘uncertain future’<nl>Ellie develops the discourse of uncertain future during this pandemic as many people may have struggled to cope with this year in general mentally and physically. With many Highstreet business and shops closing down Ellie does not know what the future will hold. She questions how the government debt will be paid off if people cannot afford to pay taxes.<tab><nl><data_extract><nl>Ellie demonstrates what the future will look like in her eyes. With the increased government borrowing Ellie is worried how that would be paid back and if she will be able to pay it back as she is worried, she may not earn enough money due to a lack in jobs and a shrinking economy. She is also concerned about the population’s future mental health, and how the long-term effects of the pandemic will play apart. As Ellie is a student, she is also worried about her student debt going up even though the debt is high in the first place as university is all online. She feels that university is a scam and is not worth the 9k she pays for online lectures. Ellie understands that it will take time to build the economy and lifestyle again and that as mental health has been well signposted, spoken about and made a topic of conversation many people may bounce back stronger than ever while using all the support given (lines 90-95). This shows that Ellie understands what the future will look like after the pandemic is over and how many people may overcome this trauma.<nl><nl>Conclusion <nl>In conclusion the discourses throughout the interview shows the scared uncertain and worried student expressing views on the pandemic that is currently damaging our lives and our mental health.  The increase in loneliness, anxiety, and depression amongst individual during this pandemic needs to be made a topic of conversation. There is a lot of help out there. Students have been greatly affected by this pandemic especially first year students as they have missed out on social events like freshers where they have chances to meet new people and make friends. This already adds to the loneliness as many of the students have moved away from home with not knowing anyone at their university. Many recent studies on the impact of the pandemic on mental health support Ellies views as mental health is on the decline due to anxiety depression and loneliness impacted by the lockdown and the isolation (Cullen et al., 2020). This analysis was from one transcript, this may not be enough to be generalised to others as many people may have had different experiences of the pandemic therefore this can be different for every individual.", "2 day conference in Helsinki from 2-4 September 2021. a central hotel that i found is the Scandic grand marina.

{"id": "5b4867fc-589a-4ef5-8268-3b4b13f90412", "discourse_types": ["essay", "text_message"], "pair": ["Aims and Research Questions<nl>The topic of research being discussed in this essay is one of the experiences during a pandemic. This was chosen as a topic of research as it is interesting to see what experiences people going through during a pandemic. It is a situation which we are all facing and gaining a deeper insight into a particular individuals experience can allow us to overcome the likely feelings of going through the pandemic alone. Thus, the main research question was: ‘How has living in a global pandemic affected one’s life?’. From this, a semi- structured interview schedule was created containing open-ended questions with impromptu follow up questions to encourage free accounts and detailed responses (Smith &amp; Osborn, 2003).<nl>Interpretive phenomenological analysis (IPA) as a suitable method:<nl>Using IPA allows us to gain what Conrad (1987) terms as an ‘insider’s perspective’. We are submerged into one’s personal experience where we try to make sense of how they view the world and use that information as a basis for interpretation. We are not taking a holistic view but rather identifying and acknowledging that every detail that has been spoken upon adds to the view that one has of the pandemic, hence the idiographic approach. This is contrasted with discourse analysis where the pandemic would be viewed as a ‘social construct’ and one would deconstruct what is being said and how language is used to construct our experience of the pandemic and whether that is a normalised concept in society (Wood, 2000). In using IPA, we look beyond COVID 19 as a pandemic, but delve deeper into how it has impacted an individual’s life. This is done through a double hermeneutic approach (Giddens,1987) hence a bottom-up analysis of data. The data was read through several times, each time noting language use, phrases and emergent feelings that stand out. Emerging themes were then transformed from the notes and commonalities between themes were combined into majorsub themes, allowing for analysis of data through a chain of connections.<nl>Analysis<nl><data_extract><nl>This major theme aims to capture the difficulties living during a global pandemic. In this unpredictable circumstance, it is evident that it is taking a toll on Mia as here we see her use negative language whilst explaining what she is going through.<nl><data_extract><nl>The sense of the pandemic being a difficult circumstance was made evident through the repetition of \"unfortunate\" which was mentioned three times during the interview. This repetition resonates with an individual thus spotlighting how bad her experience is. Mia is unable to shake the ill feelings off and due to this, it is likely that Mia cannot help but call the circumstance unfortunate as it seems like it is the only key word that can truly capture what the feeling is like. Social interactions due to government lockdowns has meant that Mia has been unable to socially interact with others as she would have done previously and as this is an unchanging circumstance, Mia has likely come to terms with it and accepted it through the \"unfortunate\" being paired with \"…it is what it is\". It suggests her experience serves some kind of ambiguity and later elaborates the effects of this ambiguity by saying the situation \"is out of my control\", rendering her useless in a sense.<nl><nl><data_extract><nl><nl>Mia’s emphasis on the word \"much\" denotes a significant emotional toll on her, regardless of anything else that may be happening in her life. This is in contrast to how life was pre-pandemic as she describes it as being \"WAY WAY better\", the expressed emphasis on \"WAY\" announces how much happier Mia was before this happened, showing the drastic shift in life experiences for Mia. Similarly, we see Mia go through a phase of disconnection – \"for example (.) yeah)\". This incomplete sentence signifies Mia trying to disengage from the situation, perhaps as a coping mechanism. She later admits that life has acutely changed as she knows one, including herself, now has to be \"careful\" when living life, bringing to light the sombre undertones of it all.<nl><nl><data_extract><nl>Here, Mia is actively aware that the difficulties she is currently facing is for the good of the wider society. She displays an act of selflessness, moving towards the viewpoint that what the government is trying to do to keep everyone safe is a good thing thus providing a contrast to the difficulties she faces. This provides a turning point to Mia’s attitude as it reveals that her subconscious knows that this is a serious, unpredictable matter that needs addressing.<nl><nl><data_extract><nl>The issue on mental health has clearly impacted Mia and has thus shaped her perception of what we call ‘freedom’. She no longer takes it for advantage, but rather takes it into her stride and appreciates the efforts taken by government to ensure all people are well and safe.<nl><nl><data_extract><nl>Here, we get a sense of her deeper emotions during the pandemic and thus this quotation calling for a double entendre. First, the likely obvious meaning of Mia feeling hidden or concealed from the world, mainly due to the lockdowns mentioned during the interview. This is coincided with her emphasis on the word \"definitely\" when asked about her lost connections during the period of lockdown. It is evident that her relationships outside of her family meant a lot to her as she describes the experience as being \"really tough\", adding to the feeling of being hidden thus indicating that the relations have influenced part of her experience and has somewhat shaped her current identity and how she is managing to cope as she is lost in something that is so big<nl>However, in saying this, we also see a shift in her feeling \"shrouded\" as due to the connection with her friends drifting away, other, stronger, connection was being built with her family. She states, \"felt more connected to my family\". As this connection has been made stronger, Mia’s sense of feeling \"shrouded\" disappears and we see her experience being shed in a much more positive light – \"it’s made me feel better about the whole situation\". She has used her family as a way of accommodating her feeling hidden and lonely, having left university and most of her friends.<nl>Lines 38-39 indicates that Mia is trying to escape her mental health issues, almost as if she is begging and crying out for help as she wants to be able to do the things that she could do beforehand without any restrictions.<nl><nl><data_extract><nl>It is evident that affirmations have somewhat aided in Mia’s recurrent undesirable experience, especially through the repetition of \"I believe\". It is as if Mia is seeking reassurance within herself for her experiences, she is trying to keep up the feelings of optimism however, her subconscious knowledge of how bad the situation is, is hindering the positivity she is trying to portray. Thus, through this emphasis, we gain a possible insight into Mia’s way of gaining control in her life, considering the unpredictability of the pandemic. <nl>\"We will get back to normality as if nothing ever happened. Life will return back to how it was before\"<nl>Here, Mia is explaining and imagining what the foreseeable future is going to hold for her, allowing her to relieve the weight of the pandemic off her shoulders. She plans to endeavour on her future plans. Nonetheless, this comes from Mia straying away from the question, seemingly getting carried away by her imagination, \"(.) lol anyways, back to working as a carer\", snapping back to reality, showing that her current experience seems to shift her focus in everyday life, even when speaking on something that is not directly linked to the pandemic.  <nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>COVID 19 seems to be more than just a ‘pandemic’. It is the one thing that we have all experienced and have in common; whether that may be for the good or bad. For some, it has been an experience of self-actualisation, a time where you find your flaws and develop them for the better. Others, however, share the same experience as Mia where it has not been such an easy journey this year considering she was battling her mental health and dealing with the loss of social relations However, in light of such a bleak situation, Mia remains hopeful about the foreseeable future, even going as far as stating what she will be able to do once the pandemic is over knowing that the situation will eventually get better. From this and the stronger connections made in her family, it is evident Mia has empowered herself which has obviously helped her significantly during these stressful times. As we all share similar aspects of Mia’s experience, we should all remain hopeful and learn to manage and cope with our emotions by seeing the pandemic as an opportunity for growth and connecting with people on deeper levels in order not to feel isolated and alone.", "h what phone🤣🤣 her phone bruk up<new>Mums changing her battery even<new>That was yours for something<new>Can’t remember what<new>Will ask mum<new>Okay I’m gna call you when I get in<new>Give me 20 mins<new>Nope it happens here too when the tank starts playing up<new>Discontinued<new>Hey<new>I don’t know<new>I did it<new>No mark<new>It was playing up somehow but I got to the end<new>I’m using you as a reference sis<new>Yes it’s bullshit I know but I need to get another job pls🤣🤣<new>WHAT?!<new>Her baby factory needs to be closed down for good wtf<new>You’re the wickedest person known to man 🤣🤣"]}
{"id": "fc09eec0-aeb0-499c-b6be-1837abf6a603", "discourse_types": ["essay", "text_message"], "pair": ["Introduction <nl>The transformation from the original labour party to the New Labour party is a significant period in British political history. It was the introduction of a new ideology with similar social democratic values as the past but with the advantage of taking account the changes in the modern era; economically and socially etc. The following essay will focus mainly on the transformation since the 1990s with some reference to the past Labour party that originated before the 1990s. Also, the essay will specifically look at the domestic policies rather than foreign policies. The impact made can be split into focusing on the three main sectors; Health, education and Law &amp; Order. The essay will be discussing whether there has been a major shift in parties or whether it is the same but just holds a new name. Further analysing the positive and negative outcome of this development. Taking into consideration whether there will be a return of new labour. <nl><nl>What is the ‘Old’ Labour party? <nl>The beginning of the Labour party was in the 1900s (Reid, 1995). The main principle being the ‘Labour party’ was to take care of the industrial workers during the Queen Victoria Era.. They wanted to protect the rights of the working class who were thought to have different rights in comparison to those in higher classes and simply treated unfairly. The first Labour government wasn't formed till 1924 when prime minister Ramsey McDonald was in power. In the beginning, the Labour party started with only a few members. As a new party forming it was difficult to make decisions on whether the public should publicly make a stand on certain decisions. One of these was to make the ‘people’ only the centre of attention. Hence introducing \"reforms to improve working conditions and working-class living standards\" (Vickers, 2004).The support towards the ‘people’ influenced the votes. One of the influences of the ideology behind the Labour party is Socialist thinking. For instance, in the past, the Labour party used socialist theory to influence the formations of foreign policy (Vickers, 2004). This socialist or social-democratic way of thinking encouraged the Labour party to promote, the values of common ownership and equal opportunity. <nl> <nl>Labour is the second most popular party in the United Kingdom right after the Conservative party (The right-wing of the British political spectrum). Even in the 20th century, the Labour parties’ values are still influenced by this socialist thinking. Most of the support and popularity the party gains is because, of its anti-capitalist position. Most new members of the Labour party in 2015 were seen as \"left behind\" by society because their view did not agree with those on the right of the political spectrum and have been deceived those on the left who feel ‘left behind’ and have been deceived by the developments of globalization which has caused social inequality (Whiteley et al., 2018). <nl>Currently, in 2019 Britain is under the conservatives – the right of the political spectrum. With <nl>the general elections scheduled to take place in December 2019, Labour is striving to get the nation on its side. Jeremy Corbyn; Leader of the Labour party and the rest of his party clearly states their vision. Within every policy set, the vision embedded is \" for the many, not the few\"(Labour party, 2019). This shows how the party is still upholding the original values it first held in the 19th century by promoting the values of equality rather than focusing on one group. <nl><nl>What is the ‘New’ Labour party? <nl>New Labour was introduced as the face of the 'new' Labour party introduced by then Prime Minister, Tony Blair. After 18 years of Britain being under the power of the conservatives, the nation finally saw the Labour party return (O'Broin, 1997). Tony Blair of Scottish origin became prime minister on the 2nd of May in 1997 after John Major had resigned. The party introduced the ideology of \"New Labour\" which focused on bringing a new approach to modernise the economy by finding a middle ground between traditional socialism and the free market economy. This is also known as the ‘third way’. Moving it from the left of the political scale to the centre. <nl>The \"Labour Party Manifesto\" of 1997 said that New Labour rejected the old approaches of \"the old left and those of the Conservative Right\" (Labour-party.org.uk, 1997). It looked for a new way that would appeal to everyone rather than just one perspective. The parties manifesto promised constitutional change and looked at improving services important to the public like the NHS service and finding new ways to help troubled students mainly in deprived areas. This quickly increased Blairs' popularity amongst not only the sick but those in education too. Also, Blair was able to heavily adjust the Policies revolving the law to keep the nation safe therefore he was supported by the general public. <nl>However, his popularity did not last long. Even though Blair attempted to change the face of Labour in a positive way some of his reforms came across as quite radical. For instance, in 1998 university students were asked to pay for tuition fees. Most Students to this day only remember him as the prime minister who re-introduced tuition fees. Other controversial issues just like this pressurised Blair into resigning as prime minister on the 27th of June in 2007 (Blair, 2007). <nl>The New Labour period carried on until 2010 with the aid of prime minister Gordon Brown but after 2010 prime minister David Cameron was appointed and Britain returned to the power of the conservatives (Heffernan, 2011).<nl> <nl>What are the similarities? <nl>New Labour in some perspectives can be seen as \"Continuous with ‘Old’\" (Allender, 2001). Even though the party has reintroduced itself as a new ideology it still promotes the same values as ‘old' Labour but instead, it has adapted to the modern world. The outcomes that the Labour party wants to achieve are still similar but the processes have changed. For example, instead of simply giving people what they want, they encouraged people to improve themselves and to find work. <nl>New Labour still concentrates on \"fairness and social justice\" (Temple, 2000).The Labour party was built originally on the idea that everyone deserves the same opportunities. Therefore, Blair was able to introduce a minimum wage in 1998(O'Hara, 2018). This way no one is paid incorrectly and instead, the pay was in alliance with the cost of living in the society, However, some may argue not everyone is treated equally because the pay depends on the individuals' age. Each age group has a different set of minimum wages. So instead it has caused further inequalities. <nl>According to an article written by the guardian, these pledges New Labour was making were what \"Labour had been making for decades and had failed in the past to keep\" (The Guardian, 2005). Therefore, supporters of New Labour could argue that in fact, it was just a party that was taking care of 'Old' Labours' reputation. They were not able to fulfil the promises made to the nation in the past. So New Labour was responsible for damage control and making sure that the Labour name was not tarnished. <nl>Unfortunately for many, one of the sad similarities is that both parties still brought Labour down. Through their time in parliament, they did not fully satisfy the nation. Before New Labour came into power, Britain thought they had hope in this new party since the previous Labour government had left them feeling \"betrayed\" (BBC News, 2010). Even though this huge support brought a rise in New Labour they suffered a fall too when there were economic crises such as the \"credit crunch\" and increases in \"income tax\". <nl><nl>What are the differences? <nl>The main difference that is widely focused on is the \"‘modernisation’ element\" which it had done to \"catch up with the times\". (Allender, 2001).This is important for a political party that wants to gain support from the nation. This does not only apply for the elder generations but also for the youth who are seeing the changes to the nation. Therefore, they would be more inclined to vote for a party that looks at the modern aspects rather than the old. <nl>When Labour was not doing as good in terms of gaining interest, a decision was made to start changing and abandoning the traditional aim of only supporting the working class. So, there was a shift from being at the left of the political meter to the centre(Allender, 2001). New Labour no longer wanted to focus on just the working class thus widening its support group. <nl>Different periods meant different types of thinking had to be introduced. This explains why after the second world war \"Keynesian\" ethics were correct to use or after Thatcher left power it was time to adapt to neoliberal ideologies (Allender, 2001). Blair decided to amend clause IV which meant it disassociated Labour from socialist thinking. It did this by starting to reduce \"trade union power and influence within the Labour movement\" (Robinson, n.d.). Thus, focusing more on the consumers rather than producers. <nl>\"Tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime\" (O'Hara, 2018).Thus clearly showed Blair had much stronger attitudes to law and order. Traditional Labour looked at economical or sociological factors to determine the \"cause of the crime\" yet Blair refused to completely do this (New Statesman, 2015) .Blair was able to spend more money on policing, making the public aware to be cautious and prevent them from committing crimes. This way New Labour was able to make a significant impact on the level of crime committed resulting in a safer environment for everyone. <nl>Instead of solely focusing on the idea of equality there was now an idea of social justice that New Labour tried to achieve. New Labour introduced welfare-to-work schemes, tackled homelessness and also encouraged the numbers in early years education to increase (Poverty.ac.uk, n.d.).The \"coalition’s 'social justice' strategy\" was considered to help those who were disadvantaged because of their environment and upbringing. New Labour wanted to make sure that those who were in the lower or middle classes still could be as successful as those in the higher class. <nl><nl>What were the positive outcomes of New Labour? <nl>Blair made more investments other than only in the law and order sector. For instance in the education sector. Spending more money on children and the younger generation meant it would help them stay focused and not on the streets. Influencing them to do positive things that could shape their future but also one of the future societies they would later form. New Labour's \"number one priority\" was education as promised in the parties’ manifesto of 1997 (Heath et al., 2013). <nl>This was later proved when achievements were made. Their investing and prioritisation achieved results such as only \"one in twelve\" secondary schools were below the basic minimum standard. This was a big development in comparison to nearly half of all schools below standard in 1997 when New Labour acknowledged the area of needed development. <nl>Funding in the health department was also increased. An article writing about that period claims There was a \" huge injection of money\" into the NHS (The Guardian, 2007). This was a change because past tory governments did not spend that much. This meant there would be in decrease like waiting times at the A&amp;E but also better facilities to access. This brought the social group of those who were sick or disabled to create stronger support for the New Labour parties' reforms. <nl>Businesses and those interested in the market system were fond of New Labours' new policies revolving the market. New Labour had thought of the \"prawn cocktail offensive\" (Giddens, 2010). This was a strategy that influenced the support from those in the finance society. This type of market economics gave consumers much more freedom in making decisions that would impact their businesses in comparison to the previous government. Due to the fact, these groups were now given shared responsibility, they felt more a part of the nation rather than before where decisions were being made without their input. <nl><nl>What were the negative outcomes of the New Labour Party? <nl>Some argued that New Labour was just \" Thatcherism continued\" (Dorling, 2010). Critique Danny Dorling argued that New Labour did not achieve anything. Instead, Blair followed the same steps as Thatcher and this resulted in the income equalities to further rise instead of creating a difference that Blair had promised. The build-up to New Labour allowing more of the NHS to become private or the introduction to university tuition fees meant a result of wealth inequality. Again, only those with money in their pockets were given more opportunities and better services. <nl>Those who look at it from a 'Relational' perspective could argue that the nation was \"encouraged... to be ‘consumers’ of services rather than participants\" (IPPR (Institute for Public Policy Research), 2016). This means there is a possibility more public services were reformed into becoming privatized. Those’ participants’ who are not fortunate enough wouldn't be able to be consumers. Supporters of ‘old' Labour were not pleased by this \"privatization by stealth\" (Vidler and Clarke, 2005). Due to the fact it just carried on creating inequalities. <nl>State welfare was not a reform everyone was pleased with. In an article analysing \"social democratic values\" (Shaw, 2003).Writer Eric Shaw discusses the idea of \"poverty traps\". Are people benefiting from the state welfare if the amount of money given is provisional and only certain groups in society are benefiting from this? An article discussing poverty within the Labour party believes New Labour seems to be instead of using poverty traps as a means to \" justify its welfare reforms\" (Stepney, Lynch and Jordan, 1999). It holds its traditional value by allowing wealth to be distributed equally. However, it withholds the nation's full support by making the rich believe they are making the poor wealthier which makes them believe it is unfair. <nl>Some could argue that New Labour spent way too much money. New Labour made many promises in its manifestos to the nation so it had to try and achieve them. Their journey to handling \" social exclusion\" meant \"heavy. Investments (such as) £1.7 billion (was) spent on the New Deal for Communities\" Instead of solely focusing on the idea of equality there was now an idea of social justice that New Labour tried to achieve. New Labour introduced welfare-to-work schemes, tackled homelessness and also encouraged the numbers in early years education to increase (Poverty.ac.uk, n.d.).However, even after all this money, there was always more problems following the ones that were solved. For instance, the recovering support needed afterward for those who had a problem with drugs was not given. Therefore, not every single social group was fully satisfied. <nl><nl>Conclusion <nl>Unfortunately for some the New Labour party saw a rise and then a fall. Britain has not seen the Labour party return back to power since 2010. Instead, the conservatives have managed to win the elections and gain the interests of the public. In the upcoming 2019 December general elections Labour has been greatly promoted but as just as the ‘Labour Party’. Since 2015, when Jeremy Corbyn was appointed as Labour party leader he shifted Labour on the political scale back to the left from the centre (Bowie,2018). Due to the fact New Labour promoted its modernised values, there’s a possibility in the future Blairs Labour could be developed and improved to meet the needs of those who disapproved of the shift to the centre. However, New Labours' dramatic fall in history and negatives outcomes could discourage the public trust in such a party. Throughout this exploration of the transformation from 'Old' Labour to New Labour, you can see clearly that there are more differences than similarities. Blair tried to change the face of Labour huge but failed to make it work. This can be shown through how the negative outcome heavily outweighs the positives. To conclude, the transformation did make a big impact on British history however not a good one. Blair worked very hard to please the nation and achieve everything he promised yet it wasn't possible to satisfy everyone and also wrong decision led to negative outcomes that Labour will be remembered for.

{"id": "0f48efd7-ad6b-4586-8913-0fa51e13cde4", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["<question1><nl>Middle managers have four main roles within an organization that they are tasked with in order to bring the firm success. Good middle managers should be sense makers of strategy and so explain and simplify what the strategic goals of the firm are, adaptors of strategy and so react to changes in the industry environment. They should also be local leaders meaning that they lead and direct those on lower levels to them while also being champions of strategic issues, going around the firm resolving and communicating the relevant issues to top management. A critical role of middle managers in strategy is sense making, as detailed in a report by Burgelman (1983) they shape the strategy of internal development and give form to the directives given from above, the Top Managers. Middle managers are the ones most directly involved with the people, products &amp; diversified groups and are therefore the impetus with which the strategy of an organisation can be implemented and developed, giving them great importance and relevance.<nl><nl>Middle managers are also implementors of strategy, one that has been developed and created by top managers, they allow for the testing of the possible flaws and failings of what has been handed down to them. Subsequently it is the middle managers again that have the responsibility and need to synthesize the information they receive while disseminating it to the top as well as operating level managers in order to facilitate the flow of information in the firm (Kuratko, 2005). This highlights the importance of middle level managers in the firm as they are in the perfect position to keep information going both ways and are able to connect top management to the lower levels of the firm which are normally very disconnected. As a result, at often times middle managers will need to ‘sell’ key issues to top management, persuading them to commit to resolving certain strategic issues they deem necessary to address. If middle level managers cannot attract the attention of senior management to fix and improve strategy this could lead to the ultimate demise of the company as a whole.<nl><nl>The eventual downfall of the mobile giant Nokia can in part be attributed to the failings of the middle managers, and the obstacles put in their way that prohibited them from completing their role as communicators and implementors of strategy. The middle managers were technological experts, the managers and their teams had a deep understanding of Symbian, the software Nokia used, it’s faults and flaws. This best placed them to give advice on what was and what wasn’t working, however the Nokia case study provides a perfect example of when communication isn’t open and positive and the aftereffects. Due to the atmosphere of fear and lack of openness, most middle managers were hesitant to mention their true feelings and communicate the problems to the top (Vuori &amp; Huy, 2016). This meant that the middle managers weren’t able to fulfil their roles, and Nokia’s fall illustrated that without them the business could not function cohesively as a unit.<nl><nl><question2><nl><nl>One of the evident issues within Nokia was that there was a great lack of trust from the Top management to the lower levels, and this trust needed to be tangible for middle managers to keep an open dialogue with senior management. In order for information to flow from the lower levels to the upper levels of an organisation trust and a sense of ontological security is necessary, middle managers need to feel like they can openly disclose failures and mistakes with top management, however this wasn’t the case in Nokia. In addition, this trust was to be harboured by top management and it was their responsibility to reduce the fear that failure would lead to punishment (Mantere, S. 2008), instead instigating and encouraging a culture of openness with a sense of security. This culture of fear of failure was not something that could be amended by middle managers but needed action from top management. Since the early 1990’s this high-pressured culture was reinforced with social and economic sanctions, which, as time moved on, further demotivated middle managers to present the real problems that were occurring within the organisation, leading to skewed information flows between the lower and higher levels.<nl><nl>The literature indicates that the motivation to sell issues to top management is based on the organisational context of the firm, the theory of Issue-selling intention as explained by Yan Ling et al. (2005) clearly highlights the underlying issues within Nokia’s management. The theory details three contextual cues that motivate middle managers to sell issues to top management: Perceived organisational support, top management’s open mindedness and relationship quality. Albeit none of these were present in Nokia. The first factor, perceived organisational support, is when employees feel safe selling issues to senior management either formally or informally. However, some at the top in Nokia were described as ‘extremely temperamental’ and seen at often times as intimidating, threatening to fire those that made mistakes, creating a hostile environment in the firm disincentivizing middle managers to sell issues. This exacerbated the other contextual cue of relationship quality, given the perceived aggression from top management the relationship between the different levels could not be trusting nor friendly and resultantly gave middle managers no reason to say things that the top would not want to hear. This would not lead to imminent problems, as seen by Nokia’s continued growth during this period, although it did lead to a sense of conformity overtime disallowing middle managers to have a positive impact on Nokia’s strategic decision making.<nl><nl>The theory of Issue-selling intention clearly defines that it should be top management facilitating an ease of communication and instigating a sense of security with bringing forward problems present in the firm. The key underlying issue was the oppressive and domineering culture present at Nokia which created a chasm between top and middle level management. Given that this culture had been present for more than a decade top management should have taken action, slowly opening more channels of communication between the middle and top levels while assuring support for those that did come forward.<nl><nl><question3><nl><nl>To anyone working for Nokia it was clear that what top management said could not be refuted, being critical was not a part of the corporate culture and there were fierce repercussions threatened for those that spoke out of line. Within this context, middle managers needed to thread the needle and influence strategic direction in a way that wouldn’t cause friction with top management. One of these ways could have been issue bundling, where the middle managers would try to tie their issues with already agreed-upon goals so as to highlight the importance of their issue to top management in a way that could not be overlooked (Dutton et al., 2001). Middle management could for example try tying their issues to valued goals such as profitability and in this way increase the likelihood of having their issue addressed. This would have been a potent way for middle managers to get senior management to take action on issues that were very evident but not brought up for fear of being reprimanded.<nl><nl>In addition to this bundling of issues, another way in which middle level management could influence strategy and implement change would be through the collaboration and wider involvement of employees in selling the issues. Communication did not flow upwards within Nokia, but it did flow horizontally within those at the same level and middle level managers discussed openly the choices they made and reports they gave top management. As a result of collaboration with likeminded individuals, the middle managers would be able to win internal allies and accumulate internal influence (Wickert, C. et al., 2018). In turn managers would feel more empowered and confident to critique the top management’s instructions, which overtime would change the corporate culture and create a more open dialogue within the business. Therefore, middle level managers could have brought their issues to the top easier if they turned to each other for support as they knew of the problems plaguing the business but were too intimidated to bring them forward.<nl><nl>On the contrary, whatever change to come about would take time to implement, as shown on the theory of ‘The transition curve’. The first two phases of this theory capture the difficulty of individuals letting go of the past and coming to terms with the need for change (Balogun et al., 2016). As depicted on the theory, it would take a lot of courage to go against the corporate culture and begin to criticise top management knowing the risks that this would entail and would then lead to lower self-confidence of the managers. A caveat however would be that this theory solely focuses on the individual, and forgets the effect of the collective, which in this case would be great given the change undertaken to influence strategy would be done by all the middle managers, cohesively.<nl><nl><question4><nl><nl>The Nokia case study illustrates the rise and fall of a global market leader and highlights the difficulties of maintaining success in the face of an ever-changing external environment. Firms need to be able to move with the times so as to not be left behind. If there are parts of the firm, especially core competencies, that aren’t working as well as they once did then the firm needs to put it behind them and move on. Incumbents are often ‘overthrown’ when they cannot recognise the threat posed by disruptive innovation and instead continue with the converse of sustaining innovation (Schmidt, G.M., 2008). This was most certainly the case with Nokia, it had invested so much in its own software Symbian that there could be no doubts about its longevity and top management continually asked to incrementally update and change it. This was a key mistake, however, as not only was the software old fashioned as compared to the newer and improved IOS systems, but it was also very difficult to work with. The fact that Nokia tried to force Symbian to work for so long is in part what led it to its eventual demise. Instead, the firm should have cut out Symbian as soon as it stopped producing results and moved on with radical OS innovation that the firm so sorely needed in order to face the increasing competition. This in turn would have reduced pressure on the software organisation and given them the time necessary to produce a quality product instead of rushing results just to meet deadlines.<nl><nl>Overtime this lack of transformational change will cause a business to become less and less in touch with the ever-changing demands of consumers. The phenomenon of Strategic Drift will resultantly occur when a firm becomes less in line with the environment within which the organization operates (Johnson, G., 1992), this was the case with Nokia and can lead to a firms eventual demise. Incumbent firms use incremental change, continuing with the practices that have made them so successful in the past, until the reach a flux. At this point managers are unsure of what to do as they have fallen so far behind market trends and resultantly if they do not start transformational change then they may die. This theory can be useful for incumbent firms to recognise the faults that they can make but should be wary that the theory is not as simple as it seems. As in the Nokia case, it took a few years before the firm really started seeing the negative results from not adapting to the times and as a result the theory may be seen as too simplistic in truly addressing the heart of the issue.<nl><nl>A final key point that incumbent firms could learn from Nokia is that they cannot become arrogant and must keep managers humble so as to mitigate the overestimation of one’s capabilities. There was a lack of concern from the top, consistent within the middle levels of management that the iPhone was no threat to them. This sentiment arose from the feelings that the firm was invincible due to its market leadership and R&amp;D strength where it had invested over $50 billion over two decades. The overzealousness of the managers would lead to an incorrect assessment of the threat of competition, and lead to an eventual decline of the firm. Incumbent firms should take this example and remain sober minded with regards to competition and learn from Nokia the effects that disruptive innovation can have.", "lo <addr1_FN>,<nl>I am abit unsure on what questions 8910 are asking for in the <subject> unit (last one).

{"id": "ec431d06-399a-4780-97f6-40ed164fb87a", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Background Information<nl>Superdrug are a UK health and beauty retailer and the second largest behind competitor Boots plc, with 900 stores across the UK and Ireland and a few European countries. In 2016 it became the UK’s fastest growing retailer in its industry, doubling its profit in the previous year. Superdrug have employed over 14,000 people across all their locations. In 2011 they launched their loyalty card as part of their ‘Take another look’ campaign and in 2015 the card was re-branded and given a new name. Presently, the loyalty card has seen a decline in the past 3 years, with less customers signing up our using their card.<nl>Aims and Objectives<nl>From the brief we understand that the overall aim of this proposal is to regain numbers in your loyalty programme and make sure that they remain consistent or rise in the long-term. Therefore, the overall objective, of this study is to investigate the cause of the decline in Superdrug’s loyalty program. This proposal will identify factors contributing to the loyalty decline in order for the marketing team to begin working on plausible solution. Some key questions that should be asked are:<nl>• Are members of the loyalty program currently satisfied with the program?<nl>• Are the current marketing efforts effective?<nl>• Why have some customers abandoned the program? What did they not like about the pro-<nl>gram?<nl>Research Design<nl>The study will consist of one quantitative and one qualitative method. The first part of the study will target customers that have left the loyalty scheme within the past 3 years. The aim is to discover why they chose to unsubscribe from the program. This will be the qualitative part of the study; a focus group, consisting of 10-15 participants, across the UK and Ireland. We recommend that the participants are as widespread as possible to avoid bias and display representation. As Focus groups are costly, we thought that we should start with a small sample to begin with, if this study proves useful it can be carried over to other European countries where Superdrug operates. The quantitative part of the study will focus on current members of the program, highlighting marketing efforts that encouraged them to join the programme and discovering whether they are currently satisfied with its offering. This information will be sought via an online questionnaire. Both stages of research will use an incentive to encourage participants to take part in the research. The reason why we would like to approach the study this is way is to gain an in-depth but representative understanding of the research problem.<nl>Research Method<nl>Qualitative Research<nl>It is unlikely that the participants would travel far for something like this, so we suggest that phone interviews are conducted. Each interview would last approximately 10-15 mins, as research has shown that this is the average time that customers would be willing to take<nl> <nl>part in this type of interview. The questions will be a mix of open-ended and closed questions allowing some quantifiable answers as well as thoughts and opinions which are equally valuable. The incentive provided could be a generous discount of 50% off all purchases at Superdrug for the next 6 months. The data will be collected, and content analysed.<nl>Quantitative Research<nl>This is supporting research to the phone interviews. Essentially, we are looking at conducting a survey for all shoppers, targeting a response rate of 200 participants, using a 15% discount as an incentive to respond. The participants will be gathered from the mailing list of beauty card users in the UK and Ireland. The survey will ask questions related to their overall experience of being a card user, from what marketing tools encouraged them to sign up to if they would recommend the service and an overall numerical rating of the service. The responses will be collected and analysed by a computer system.<nl>Sampling technique<nl>The sample of Customers are a mix of previous and current program users. The aim is to identify the similarities between the groups likes and dislikes about the program which should help identify the causes for the program’s decline. The telephone interviews should consist of female participants ranging from age 14-25 (they’re main target audience). Superdrug should contact participants via email, which should be stored in their database.<nl>Consider potential methods for data analysis<nl>The telephone interviews will be analysed using thematic coding. Using the interview transcripts, the responses will be sorted into broad themes and the number of times these appear will be recorded in a tally. The highest scoring ‘theme’ will be an indication as to the cause. This can be correlated with the answers received from the survey. As for the survey, all answers can be calculated via a computer, which can later be converted into bar charts or other visual graphs for easy presentation to management teams.<nl>Ethical conduct<nl>In both cases it is Important to get consent from all participants. In particular the participants of the telephone interview, who are ex-loyalty card users, there should be no harassment from the interviewer nor should the participant be made to feel bad for their decision to leave the program. All participants need to be made aware beforehand that the interview will be recorded, allowing them the opportunity to withdraw if they choose. For all participants taking part in the survey, terms and conditions outlining what the data will be used for should be agreed to. For participants that are under the age of 18, it should be made clear that a parent needs to consent to the terms and conditions.", "ning SIr, <nl><nl><nl>I approached you this morning abut the <topic1> Presentation.

Firstly, Hotel Haven has a superior room between the 2nd and 4th of September, a 30-minute drive from the airport into the city centre. The hotel is the closest to the water that I could find, averaging Â£163 a night. The room also includes a \"great\" breakfast, as booking.com states; however, local cafes are available if you wish to venture out. Cafe Roasberg serves \"The Best\" Coffee and is a hotspot for breakfast options within a distance from the hotel. Roasberg is a 10 minute walk8 minute bus9minute car journey from the hotel. For local cuisine options, I discovered Kalerian Stew, a traditional meat dish that combines pork and beef, and no seafood ingredients are included. Konstan Molja is famous for its stew in Helsinki, and the restaurant is a 21 minute walk8 minute drive16-minute bus from the hotel. Regarding museums to explore the city's history, the national museum of Finland explores the regions past and cultural heritage. This is a 21 minute walk6 minute drive12-minute bus from the hotel. Souvenir shops conveniently surround the hotel, and I have chosen Kankurin Tupa, a 6-minute walk around the corner. They appear to have a large selection of items which I'm sure you'll be able to find something suitable for your children. Finally, G Livelab in Helsinki is an 8 minute walk4 minute drive from the hotel and has good wine and cocktails available. Along with this, numerous reviews state that they have a good atmosphere, and although they are primarily a live music venue, they host the occasional improv comedy night for 10 Euros.

{"id": "b2053a97-0917-4544-b54b-6ba16172b5ce", "discourse_types": ["essay", "text_message"], "pair": ["Thank you for visiting. <nl><nl>Will you be able to bring a wrongful dismissal claim against Wildlife Wonders?<nl>To legally bring a Wrongful Dismissal Claim (WDC), the employer must have unjustifiably breached fundamental contractual clauses, resulting in the employee’s consequential loss. Applying this, did Wildlife Wonders (WW) breach a term in your contract, causing you consequential loss? You are likely to be successful arguing WW breached your implied term of mutual trust and confidence, as Narinder disrespected you in front of your colleagues and did not keep your performance issues confidential. Managers are obliged to ensure workplaces offer senses of belongingness and motivation, but this was not your experience. <nl><nl>You can argue breach of Job clause, because Narinder asked you to perform duties outside your contract which were unreasonable, given you are a cameraman and not a speaker. Narinder transferred you to Accounting, which is not the job responsibilities expected from a cameraman. This may give rise to a breach in your renumeration clause, because your accounting transfer, may have increased your salary and should be paid accordingly. Your resulting consequential loss resulting is your resignation and lack of work.<nl><nl>Eligibility to bring WDC, requires the claimant to be an employee. Applying the legal test of an employee, did you wear uniform whilst working? Were you integrated and controlled by WW employees? As your manager, Narinder assigned you projects. You used a company car. This validates you were sufficiently integrated and controlled within WW, deeming you an employee. <nl><nl>The law requires the claimant must be dismissed by their employer, under misconduct. WW did not dismiss you, but you resigned. The law recognises resignations as constructive dismissal, providing it has been done at a reasonable time, justified through contractual breaches and is evidenced in writing. You telephoned Narinder your resignation notice, giving reasons. This does not take imminent, legal effect because you must provide your resignation in writing. I advise you email Narinder your resignation notice, for this will reach Narinder faster. Following this, you will be eligible to bring WDC against WW. <nl><nl>Can you bring an Unfair Dismissal Claim against Wildlife Wonders?<nl>To bring an Unfair Dismissal Claim (UDC), the law requires the employer to defend the claimant’s claim. You are likely to succeed with UDC against WW, so I shall focus on this. <nl><nl>To be lawfully eligible, the claimant must be an employee. Following my explanation in WDC section, you satisfy this. Law places two additional requirements. Firstly, the claimant must not be excluded from claiming due to their occupation. A cameraman is very unlikely to be excluded and you have not signed a compromising agreement with WW. Secondly, the claimant must have worked for their employee for a continuous period of two years. you have worked for WW for ten years, allowing you eligibility to bring UDC.  <nl><nl>Procedural requirements<nl>Regarding time limits, the law established a 3 months minus one day from effective date of termination, deadline for WDC submitted to tribunals. WDC submitted to court have 6 year deadline.  If you resigned on 28th November 2020, you have until 27th February 2021 to submit your WDC to a tribunal. You will have until 27th November 2026 to submit your WDC to court. As you want to bring a WDC and UDC, you are advised to bring both claims to a tribunal. As your salary is £52,000, any award exceeding £25,000 will be taxed and presented in court. Bringing both claims, means your legal fees is likely to be subtracted from your compensation, allowing you to bring your claims to a tribunal.  <nl><nl>I advise you submit your WDC to the tribunal as soon as possible, I am happy to assist you with this. The tribunal requires you to attend Early Conciliation meeting to settle your dispute. ACAS is an independent statutory body, aiming to provide early conciliations. You will receive a certificate number which must be presented to the tribunal as evidence of attempted conciliation. If the dispute is not resolved with WW, the tribunal will give you an additional month to submit your WDC to them. You will have until 27 March 2021 to submit WDC. You still remain an employee of WW, as you have not evidenced your resignation in writing and have not been dismissed.<nl><nl>Like WDC, the law requires the claimant to have been dismissed by their employer. You must prove you have been dismissed from WW, namely confirming your resignation in writing. Like WDC, in UDC you must attend ACAS hearing, in an attempt to settle your dispute.  <nl><nl>If you choose to formally resign and have attended ACAS hearing, you must attach the certificate number onto the ET1 Tribunal Claim Form. I am happy to assist in completing this. This will be sent to WW, who will have 28 days to respond to your claim through the ET3 Tribunal Claim Form. <nl><nl>What would be the prospects of you succeeding with each claim?<nl>You have the burden to prove your WDC and UDC. As I stated, you are likely to successfully justify both claims. Once WW have received your ET1 Form, the burden will be on them to defend your claim. They must justify their actions as being reasonable, supporting your employment contract. Narinder will attempt to argue she was reasonable in sending you to different countries for projects,  as your job is to film nature. However, Narinder was unreasonable in being disrespectful to you. Given Narinder’s lack of knowledge and your strong reputation, Narinder should have understood you. <nl><nl>Narinder has not justified her reasons for transferring you to accounting, knowing it is outside your contract and you dislike it. This represents an unjustifiable breach in your job clause, as you were not contracted to deliver talks and work in accountancy but contracted to film creatures. Narinder is unlikely to successfully justify her disrespectful comments to you. Also, you did not consent to your performance issues (should remain confidential) being publicised. <nl><nl>WDC Prospect<nl>It is unlikely WW will succeed in defending your claim, unless it amounts to gross misconduct, or WW reverse their decision of you working in Accounting department and allow you to resume working as a cameraman. <nl><nl>A tribunal will lawfully consider gross misconduct, as evidence of the employee breaching their contract, so bad that it damages the relationship between the employer and employee. This would allow the employer to dismiss the employee, without worrying about potential WDC against them, as the employee’s breach has invalidated their contract and rights to notice. Here, WW best way of proving gross misconduct is through your poor performance in the last two-three years. The tribunal however, are more likely to consider this to be minor misconduct or serious misconduct. They will consider that your poor performance was due to WW breaching your job clause by assigning you duties which were outside of your contract and profession. The tribunal will also consider your strong reputation. <nl><nl>WW may be able to defend your WDC by reversing their decision of you working in accounting and allow you to resume working as a cameraman. You will only be successful in arguing breaches in your contract, if WW did not allow you to work your notice period or they paid you less than the value of your entitled benefits, namely your pension, paid leave, discretionary Christmas bonus and use of Land Rover.<nl><nl>In law, your minimum notice period is implied into your employment contract. The higher notice period indicated in your contract or legislation will prevail. Your contract entitles you to eight weeks’ notice, but law states you are entitled to ten weeks’ notice; as you have worked with WW for ten years. Therefore WW must pay you ten weeks’ worth salary notice, plus monetary value of benefits you would have been entitled to during your notice period. <nl><nl>However, if you choose to evidence your resignation in writing, your resignation will be legal meaning your right to work your notice period will be lost. However WW are legally obliged to fulfil your payment in lieu clause, by paying you monetary value for your company benefits such as paid leave, Christmas bonus, use of Land Rover and Pension scheme. <nl><nl>UDC Prospect <nl>It is unlikely WW will be able to defend your claim, unless they satisfy the tribunal’s requirements arguing they were fair and reasonable in dismissing you for one or more of the five reasons established in law and in doing so, they followed a fair dismissal procedure. Here the burden will be on WW to prove this and must also justify your resignation. If WW are unable to defend your resignation reasons (which I think is likely), you will succeed in arguing WW constructively dismissed you. <nl><nl>Applying this, WW may use ‘other substantial reason,’ ground to defend your dismissal; namely they incurred losses from your projects. Another fair reason WW may use to defend your dismissal may be ‘misconduct,’ regarding your work performance. This is unlikely to succeed, as WW would be required to follow ACAS Disciplinary Guidelines, such as opting for Mediation with you, before dismissing you. As with WDC, the tribunal would require evidence of your work performance from the last two-three years.<nl><nl>Whether you was dismissed withwithout notice, WW must prove they dismissed you following a fair and reasonable dismissal procedure. Here, after orally resigning you have not met with Narinder to further discuss your decision. As the employer, WW should have done this to ensure your dismissal was fair but because they did not, you are likely to be successful in arguing your UDC; as silence from your resignation was a negative response. <nl><nl>What are your options, and what would be the advantages and disadvantages of pursuing each option?<nl>Please find below a list of options available to you. <nl><nl>Option 1: Do not resign and tolerate Narinder’s behaviour.<nl><nl>Advantages:<nl>• You continue to have a regular job and income.<nl>• No stress about finding alternative work.<nl>• Saves time and money, as you will not spend thousands on your legal bill. <nl><nl>Disadvantage:<nl>• Narinder’s disrespectful behaviour may not change.<nl>• The reasonable time for you to resign and argue constructive dismissal from WW will pass. <nl><nl>Option 2: Do not resign, but seek an amicable solution to address Narinder’s behaviour. <nl><nl>Advantages: <nl>• Same as Option 1. <nl>• WW may appreciate your feedback, leading to improvements in Narinder’s behaviour. <nl>• WW may assign you a new line manager. <nl><nl>Disadvantage:<nl>• Same for Option 1, but hopefully this will not happen. <nl><nl>Option 3: Do not resign, but raise a grievance case against Narinder. <nl><nl>Advantages:<nl>• Same as option 2, however WW may consider this to be a drastic measure to take. <nl><nl>Disadvantage:<nl>• Same as Options 1-2. <nl><nl>Option 4: Hand in your notice but do not claim. <nl><nl>Advantages:<nl>• You will be free from Narinder’s treatment. <nl>• You will save time and money in bringing a claim against them.<nl>• You will receive all benefits you are entitled to during your notice period. <nl><nl>Disadvantages:<nl>• You will be unemployed after your notice period.<nl>• Stressful finding another job. <nl><nl>Option 5: Resign and argue constructive dismissal under WDC and UDC.<nl><nl>Advantages:<nl>• You will receive your entitled benefits had you worked your notice period. <nl>• You will feel happy seeing Narinder being disciplined for her behaviour.<nl>• Feel happy seeing WW negative publicity.<nl><nl>Disadvantages:<nl>• Same as Option 4.<nl>• There is no guarantee of winning which may waste your time and money. <nl><nl>I think Option 2 is beneficial to you, however it is your choice. <nl><nl>What remedies might you seek, and, if they include financial compensation, how much -providing figures where possible - is a court or tribunal likely to order Wildlife Wonders to pay out to you, should you succeed with each claim?<nl><nl>WDC<nl>The tribunal may award you financial compensation, an injunction andor declaration that WW wrongfully dismissed you. The tribunal is likely to award you compensation, as this suits your needs better because a declaration will financially damage WW more due to negative publicity. <nl><nl>Your compensation will be depend on if WW allow you to work your notice period or they pay you the monetary value of your entitled benefits instead. The tribunal will order WW to pay you 10 weeks’ worth salary (£10,000), as this is your legal notice period entitlement. This will include your benefits entitlements, namely your pension of approximately £4,000. Your notice will continue throughout the Christmas period, hence the tribunal will order WW to pay you your contractual Christmas Bonus (£1,560). As this is discretionary, the tribunal will order this, if you receive your ‘Christmas [bonus]’ regularly. If so, WW must pay your bonus, as this constitutes an employee contractual ‘right[s] to receive.’ <nl><nl>Currently, you have taken two days’ leave. I doubt you would taken more, during your notice. Legally, employers must compensate employees for untaken leave, because employers have benefitted from extra employee work. Therefore, the tribunal will award you 26 days’ worth salary (£3,703.96). To avoid this, WW may encourage you to take leave during your notice. <nl><nl>Your compensation totals £19,263.96. This includes notice salary (£10,000), Pension (£4,000), untaken leave (£3,703.96) and Christmas bonus (£1,560). Without Christmas bonus your compensation totals £17,703.96. Your desire to keep Land Rover may reduce your compensation. Subtracting the car, your compensation totals £11,763.96 or £10,203.96 without Christmas bonus. When negotiating with WW do not make it obvious you wish to keep the car. Given your strong reputation and to avoid publicity, WW may allow you to keep the car. If your accounting transfer increased your salary, the tribunal will order WW to pay the difference. Your overall compensation is below tribunal’s maximum award of £25,000. I advise you bring your WDC and UDC to a tribunal. <nl><nl>UDC<nl>The tribunal can lawfully re-instate you into your current job, with Narinder continuing as your manager. Or they may re-engage you into your current job, with a new manager and WW branch. The tribunal is unlikely to re-instate or re-engage you, as your relationship with WW is damaged. However, if you wish to be re-instated or re-engaged, the tribunal will consider this. <nl><nl>Your compensation will consist of basic and compensatory awards. <nl>Basic Award <nl>Tribunal will award you £6,300 based on your weekly gross salary (£525 cap), age, and 10 years of service. <nl><nl>Compensatory Award<nl>The maximum tribunal may award is your current gross salary (£78,000), as it is below £86,444 cap. This may be lower (£25,000), as this is fair, equitable; considering time taken to secure another job.<nl><nl>If both claims succeed, the tribunal will only award you compensation for UDC (£84,300) because this includes your salary and benefits lost during your notice. The tribunal may be inclined to reduce your compensation award, as early payments give you investment opportunities, but this is unlikely due to the Coronavirus recession. <nl><nl>Given your strong reputation, skills and compensation award, it is possible for you to create your own business providing you have no competitive restrictive covenants. The tribunal will consider this.  The tribunal will consider your skills, experience and how long it will take you to find another job. If you are currently looking for jobs and havewill attend an interview, please inform me because the tribunal will reimburse your expenses made, namely travel fee and newspapers subscriptions. <nl><nl>Additional information<nl>Please email me your employment contract, as I may identify further benefit entitlements and if WW can allow you to work your notice or pay you in lieu. If not, WW cannot enforce restrictive covenants and other clauses against you; for this invalidates your contract.<nl><nl>Please confirm if you have opted out of Working Time Regulations 1998, as this determines your ability to be compensated for untaken leave. <nl><nl>I leave you to reflect and will contact you for further instructions. <nl><nl>Yours Sincerely, <nl>", "e you are all good tho ! 🥰🥰<new>Indeed !

{"id": "f44c536b-a5cd-4ed9-bb16-cc83788bab36", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Introduction<nl>This essay will discuss the notion that conscionability is regarded as a ‘dangerous black horse’. Though it poses ‘immediate danger to the foundations of the law’  it holds a certain appeal within Equity. Further, it will criticise Birk’s position that this ‘amorphous concept’ simply conceals to private intuition. As this piece progresses, opinions of scholars who propose unique and interesting alternatives will be analysed with the final position being that Birks’ does not wholly present a modern perspective on such a diverse definition. <nl><nl>Outdated approach<nl>Perhaps to consider the role of conscience within legal disputes, one should turn to their private intuition. However, to venture into this ‘uncertain terrain’, by adopting a narrow approach, the courts are reversing the trends of equity. Birk’s reliance upon private intuition directly contradicts legal decision-making and therefore, for judges to rely on their intuitive conscience gives rise to additional subjectivity and seriously harms the rule of law. Nonetheless, it raises the concern as to why this indefinable concept of unconscionability should be accepted. Maxwell states that this terminology conflicts with values of certainty; the law must facilitate prediction rather than accept terms which are heavily subjective and uncertain. <nl><nl>Additionally, though conscience can be criticized for its ‘judicial moral subjectivism’, when judges make these decisions, they are essentially moral and based on ‘normative practices (…) that already exist in society and outside the law’. Therefore, this private intuition is really the perception individuals have when interpreting external standards of morality and Dworkin asserts that judges interpret this morality by presupposing laws of the community. Instead, the flawed doctrine of Equity gives rise to scepticism as opposed to conscience itself. <nl><nl>Conscience, subjectivity &amp; The Rule of Law <nl>To understand conscience, it is vital to consider opinions of scholars when assessing the truth in Birks’ statement. Perhaps looking at the rule of law can provide better clarification. Harding suggests that there must be a ‘counterbalance’ for the continued use of unconscionability because society can lose respect for the law if legal rules are not strictly applied in situations where exploitation of unjust outcomes are used for personal gain. Though conscience is ‘expressive’, it remains impossible to anticipate eventuality, therefore, mechanisms must be established to protect formal rules from being opportunistically exploited. Equity serves as this very mechanism by supplementing common law and the adjustment of rules adhering to extra-legal standards. Here, different observations of equity are presented and Birks’ reliance on intuition seems questionable. <nl><nl>When observing conscience in equity, formal rules have been altered to make perfect moral sense. In common law and equitable liabilities, the courts consider ‘moral clarity’ rather than blindly following law. There is an evaluative aspect here where subjective interpretation is necessary to encourage ‘moral deliberation’. Moreover, it is odd to refute inherent subjectivity within private law reasoning. This encourages a mechanical, undesirable process inhibiting the progression of equity. Nonetheless, when considering these obligations, not all moral duties can be enforceable and there is great debate on whether legal obligations ‘invariably’ gives rise to moral ones. But should it be accepted that equitable obligations enforce moral duties, the individual must consider what they should morally do as opposed to what the law asserts. <nl><nl>Agnew suggests that instead of ‘private intuition’, reflecting morally upon a situation contributes to the authority of private law with ‘moral legitimacy’ being easier accepted. It is easier to conform to this ideal in contrast to Birks’ highly plain and systematic approach. However, Birks critiques remain superior in that invocation of conscience in relation to equitable obligations generate great confusion and legal uncertainty. This does not seem to be a ‘realistic aspiration’ of the law. Confusion arises where it is difficult to assume differences between directly enforceable moral duties, and equitable obligations that have no legal standing. Agnew proposes that to limit conscience to cases where courts underwrite moral duties as legal or equitable obligations seems more appropriate. There is greater transparency but its ‘explanatory limits’ must be properly understood. This would fix the need to rely on personal intuition. Nonetheless, courts must be willing to accept a precautionary approach by addressing the confusion conscience poses in the first place.  <nl><nl>The influence of conscience in the courts <nl>Though conscience prevents the ‘rigidity of rules’, its unspecific nature leaves plenty of debate regarding its judicial discretion and capricious outcomes’. Firstly, equitable remedies must be freely available when the claimant’s sole action is to prove unconsciousable behaviour. Case law supports this position with judges asserting that demonstrating unconscionability would suffice. Lord Denning submits that when combining resulting and constructive trusts, they can be imposed ‘where justice and good conscience require it’. Nonetheless, critique indeed expected. In the case of Lloyd’s Bank Plc v Rossett, concern over this broader approach was quickly reined in by the House of Lords and the shift towards a more selective one was needed. This concept is well represented in Australian case law where there is greater emphasis of conscience within equity. In the case of Tanwar, when assessing \"unconsciousable conduct’, the court determined that it ‘encourages false notions’, and it is an ‘equitable defence’. Therefore, conscience must demonstrate liability; it is a ‘baseline to judge behaviour’. Similarly, in Cobbe v Yeoman’s Row, conscience was referred to as an ‘objective value judgement’. This suggests conscience as an objective criterion to judge behaviour. Though Birks states that conscience is unspecific, conflicting case law argues quite the opposite; it is appropriate to assume conscience as this baseline in which actions of unreasonable nature are assessed correctly.  <nl><nl>Nonetheless, conscience gives excessive discretionary power to judges. For judges to assume subjective perspectives on a case-by-case basis undermines the integrity of the judiciary and the concept of equity. Within law, certainty is imperative, and an objective conscience allows the law to be better respected and clearly defined. This perceived subjectivity and arbitrariness has existed for many years with post-medieval judgements slowly fading the true definition of conscience.  Therefore, with its endless interpretations, it remains unsurprising that uncertainty remains. Regardless, though it appears that centrality of conscience has been reaffirmed in modern times, equity still lacks clarity within the courts. It was held in Harris v Williams-Wynne, that where a property covenant was breached, the test the courts took in determining whether the act was unconscionable would be for the claimant to enforce their rights at the date of breach. In these instances, judges focus on the facts of ‘each individual case’. Consequently, this language directly conflicts with the ‘value of certainty in commercial life’. Though he does not explicitly agree with Birks, Turner states that there is a severe ‘lack of judicial guidance’. But Hudson disagrees in that conscience is ‘deeply misunderstood’. Though these two scholars present contrasting perspectives to that of Birks, they also conflict with each other; it can be said that conscience is a curious concept that brings forth debates.  Opposing views give rise to further discretion, possibly damaging the overall meaning of conscience.  <nl><nl>Conscience &amp; trusts<nl>In the case of resulting trusts, Lord Browne presents an argument in Westdeutsche asserting that equitable jurisdiction to enforce trusts depends on the conscience of those who’s legal interest is being affected. One cannot be considered a trustee if he was unaware of the facts that affect his conscience; unaware to hold the property for others in the case of a constructive or implied trust where it would directly influence his conscience. This poses great problems. For the enforcement of proprietary trusts to depend on the conscience of the legal interest being affected’ seems flawed, it greatly affects the law relating to the creation of these interests and confusion is bound to occur. Though he states that an equitable interest, once created will be enforceable against a holder of the property ‘without notice’, it is confusing to align this with his comments where enforceability depends on the conscience of the holder. There is a distinguishing feature here; it does not make sense to assume that conscience of the recipient should be affected ‘but for’ this lack of notice: that it gives rise to a resulting trust. The creation of such interests influence other factors, namely risks and insurance; Birks states that this cannot be left to vague measures of conscience. Therefore, this confusion is ‘intolerable’. The need for conscience to be integrated with common law concepts seems more effective in order to reduce the judicial discretion it so freely provides. <nl><nl>Conclusion <nl>Overall, scholars propose alternative meanings which do provide relief to some extent, but the definition remains confusing. Nonetheless, intuitive decision making cannot mould itself into modern society with Birks himself stating conscience can never be ‘perfectly autonomous’. The inherent subjectivity and private law reasoning attached to conscience is vital in the progression of law. Should we adopt a narrower approach, the courts may be too restrictive. Thus, with appropriate measures put in place, the subjectivity conscience demands can provide suitable solutions and generate greater relief, doing a great deal for its role within equity law.", "<addr1_NN>,<nl><nl>Thank you for the feedback.

{"id": "feadb749-318c-4444-9ea8-3bd6a121ffb3", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["The introduction to this essay will explain doping as a form of corruption and will cite statistics to convey the extent of its effect on sport. This will be accompanied by an examination of what the spirit of sport is. This essay's critical debate aims to expose WADA's ineffectiveness in ensuring that the spirit of sport triumphs over the doping corruption. In this regard, WADA's loose grip on national and sport’s governing bodies can be seen to disrupt clean athletes. The debate then will shift to how WADA's code is fundamentally discriminatory against athletes from developing countries, causing less privileged athletes to face harsher realities for the committing the same offences as their contestants. These problems are exacerbated by corruption in different countries where the punishments handed down by authorities do not reflect the crimes. The eventual finding is that WADA is unsuccessful because it lacks necessary authority. This essay will also offer a critique of the proposal of legalised doping, shedding light on its shortcomings. It will be concluded that an increase in WADA’s power is required for the spirit of sport. The conclusion is that WADA will only be able to promote the spirit of sport effectively when they are the final arbiter in enforcing the code. This essay includes insights from Sports science, medicine, sociology, ethics, psychology and economics to support its claims.<nl>Corruption is defined as ‘dishonest or illegal behaviour, especially of people in authority’. Gorse and Chadwick suggest corruption in sport includes illegal, immoral or non-ethical activities, which intentionally seek to distort the outcome of a sports competition for one or more parties' personal benefit. , Gorse and Chadwick analysed 2,089 cases of corruption in sports, where doping was present in 95.64% of cases.<nl>The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) is responsible for leading a collaborative worldwide movement for doping-free sport. They stress that anti-doping programmes foster the ‘spirit of sport’ which includes values like ethics, joy, education, health and fair play. According to the World Anti-Doping Code (WADC), doping is contrary to the spirit of sport, so impressions of sporting achievement are important. When an athlete achieves success, it is helpful that their performances are not overshadowed by scepticism. The Sport of cycling can be used as an example.<nl>Reeth and Lagae surveyed if doping was acceptable among different demographics in the cycling community. They reported a clear view that doping contradicts the spirit of fair play. When Chris Froome became the first Briton to win the Tour de France twice, his second victory was marred by doping allegations. Froome was eventually proven innocent, but there is no doubt that the distrust created by Lance Armstrong made public scepticism inescapable for anyone that proceeded him. From a sociological point of view, this proves that the social significance of any sport is heavily reliant on its winning athletes. These winners are currently expected to work honestly for their accomplishments. This might be done by training hard simply with a special talent. However, the vital spirit of sport is undermined if the organisation which regulates anti-doping is unsuccessful in doing so.<nl>It is very possible that chalking Armstrong’s wins did nothing to solve the problems he created. When he became the first cycling colossus, he grew to establish a legacy that would see his accomplishments rise in importance as the sport's history evolves and more athletes fail to better him. That became a double-edged sword when anti-doping campaigns erased these victories, thus profoundly undermining the sport's past and underlying spirit. A relentless scepticism of innocent winners could also turn athletes away from the sport, fearing the scrutiny their lives would face if they had any success. Surely any failure to solve this issue could damage the spirit of a sport and this failure can be traced back to WADA?<nl><nl>Clean athletes often lose out<nl>The WADC exists to maintain a fundamental right to compete in doping-free competition. This is why, if the WADC fails, any athlete who competes clean suffers the consequences. It is often the case that those who win are recalled, occasionally with a thought for second and third place, while those who finish below the podium positions sometimes fade into obscurity. These individuals forfeit the life-changing status and wealth that comes with success because they miss out on awards to dishonest athletes who dope. It is therefore important WADA ensures ‘clean athletes don’t suffer the devastation of stolen medal moments’. <nl>Unfortunately, many athletes have already been affected by this calamity. The Associated Press estimated that $410,000 could be owed to thousands of athletes because of only four track and field players who never returned their prize money from the Olympic Games after being caught doping.  Athletes are also sometimes given a cash sum by their country for placing well in a sporting event. Moreover, those that do not make it to the podium are deprived of recognition; Jo Pavey, who finished fourth in the 10,000m at the 2007 World Championships, was still waiting for her bronze medal nearly a decade later. <nl>When it comes to fixing these injustices, WADA loses out just as much. Appeals to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) can currently be made to recover an athlete’s losses, but the views of CAS rarely align with WADA’s recommendations. On top of that CAS also risks having its own decisions set aside by the Swiss Federal Court. The current format then receives criticism because many of its legal efforts have focused disproportionately on the suspected athlete’s right to fair process, meaning they fail to provide clean athletes with the attention they deserve. On the other hand, there are reasons why suspected athletes deserve reasonable legal process, such as mitigating factors. Goalkeeper Andre Onana was recently suspended for mistakenly taking a painkiller that turned out to be a banned substance. Although it is the athletes' duty to ensure that no banned substance enters their bodies, ignoring defendants entirely in favour of clean athletes does not seem like the most reasonable alternative. <nl>That being said, allowing implicated athletes from Russia to compete in the 2016 Olympics, did nothing to convey any consequences of doping on a national scale. When the IOC refused to follow any of WADA's guidelines on Russia it showed a blatant disregard for the spirit of sport and for the right to compete in doping-free sport. Likewise, the decisions of CAS have been criticised for being inconsistent and still allowing corrupt athletes to participate. Despite CAS’ shortcomings, it is nevertheless the responsibility of the WADC to provide guidance on these matters, but rules for state endorsed doping did not exist at the time. Critics have argued that not addressing that issue was ‘… the most detrimental aspect of the Code’.<nl>One might then argue WADA's inability to protect all athletes who participate clean does not imply that they are the sole culprit, since this would set an impossibly high standard for WADA. However, when the authors of the universal anti-doping rule do not agree with the enforcers, it creates a divide between the different anti-doping authorities to the detriment of any clean athlete. More recently it was reported that WADA has opened a formal investigation into UK Anti-Doping for enabling British Cycling to conduct its own investigation into one of its riders. This supports the idea that WADA's lack of authority when imposing the spirit of sport is frequently amplified by the missteps of National and Sports Governing Bodies.<nl><nl>There is not a ‘level playing field’<nl>It may also be argued that the current anti-doping approach does not account for the differences caused by the various settings in which athletes live. This means there is not a fair playing field in sport. Firstly, it is not considered an unfair advantage to live in a wealthy country, yet athletes that do have a significant edge over their rivals from developing countries. Kayser and others argue that these conditions can sometimes come close to doping. <nl>Scholars from developing countries have argued that reaching a world class status in sports often reflects excellent equipment and facilities. Despite this, sport is not a top priority in any developing state. Research suggests that these countries instead rely on imported goods and sponsorships to provide amenities. The outcome is that athletes cannot become involved in ‘sophisticated doping’ in the same way as their competitors since they often lack the resources. Sports facilities in emergent countries are often not maintained because of their financial costs. Consequently, their usage is reduced which leads to a smaller number of local sports competitions. Further, UNESCO suggested in 2013 that there were considerable widespread shortfalls in the quality and quantity of facility and amenity provision, especially in low income countries. For that reason it would be absurd to conclude that talents from developing nations are ever really on a fair playing field, even from a young age. <nl>Corruption in developing countries such as Kenya only compounds these issues. WADA recognised that the doping practices of Kenyan athletes are ‘unsophisticated, opportunistic, and uncoordinated’. This is because testing techniques for older, well-known substances such as Erythropoietin (EPO) are well established meaning its users are easier to spot. The problem is that anti-doping tests are not equally as effective for athletes with access to newer substances. The comparatively unsophisticated doping practises of Kenyan athletes means they are typically caught, and therefore penalised, more often than their competition. This goes to show that a level playing field hardly ever exists.<nl>Operation Aderlass demonstrated these problems in action. In endurance sports, autologous blood doping (ABD), which allows athletes to supply more oxygen to their muscles, has been a big advantage for athletes until discovery., Only then did endurance athletes own up to doing it, probably because they felt that they would be singled out eventually. By contrast, some of Kenya’s highest profile athletes have been identified and banned from their sports because their doping practises were easier to identify. This demonstrates that not all cheaters are treated equally, not because some have committed more serious crimes than others, but because they are committing the same crime with less success.<nl>It may be argued that the nature of this imbalance seriously undermines whether anti-doping efforts are worthwhile and whether they help the spirit of sport. However, it is unfair to expect authorities to always be on top of doping. Still, WADA's anti-doping programmes aim to maintain sport's level playing field. When only certain athletes can use doping to their advantage, these ideals are damaged. As a result of this inequality, talented athletes from developed countries are forced to pursue other opportunities, and the sport suffers the consequences. Ultimately the disparity in doping practises also creates confusion around winners, making it difficult for people to trust whether achievements are the result of hard work or corruption. These are problems that WADA must resolve if it wants to restore confidence in the spirit of sport and offer better opportunities to athletes from developing countries who may risk being left behind if they compete clean.<nl><nl>WADA cannot enforce consequences<nl>'Operation Puerto' in Spain exemplified how WADA has frequently been obstructed in addressing its concerns. Multiple athletes were involved in this sandal. The Criminal Court of Madrid ruled that the evidence discovered by police should be destroyed, a verdict that WADA later challenged. Its former director general, David Howman, argued that ‘at times it seemed as if the intention was to delay any proper approach’. WADA were also unable to name the implicated athletes due to their own statute of limitations policy. <nl>The inability to reveal these facts proves that perceptions of achievement can sometimes be distorted to shield athletes at all costs. In the 2000s, Spanish athletes were worshiped as long as they continued to make Spain a sporting powerhouse (Soule and Kudovic 2011). Dr Fuentes confessed that his clients included athletes from many different sports. One might then argue that Spain and WADA still bear the same burden as in 2006: exposing the facts. A failure to do so not only casts doubt on those in power, but it also calls into question their ability to enforce the WADC. As a consequence, one might argue the values enshrined in the spirit of sport are abandoned at the price of one country.<nl>The implications of Operation Puerto still pale in comparison to those of Russia's state-led anti-doping regime. It involved the director of the anti-doping laboratory in Russia creating a mixture of banned substances that he gave to dozens of Russian athletes, enabling the most controversial doping scheme in history. While WADA endorsed a ban of 4 years, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) substituted a 2 year ban. It also repealed a WADA provision that would have forced Russian athletes to make clear that they were not involved with the scheme. The US anti-doping agency chief suggested the ruling was ‘a catastrophic blow to clean athletes, the integrity of sport, and the rule of law.’<nl>For many this has made it clear that WADA is a substandard organisation when it comes to enforcing its own code. In many countries, WADA must depend on the authorities' willingness to implement effective anti-doping policies and it is clear this scarcely happens. Furthermore, the implementation of the code is contingent governing bodies’ ability to punish the guilty parties for their violations of the code. Instead, these organisations often fall short of their responsibilities, raising doubts about their ability to enforce the code in light of the spirit of sport. This can only come back to bite WADA who are trapped in a vicious circle of making suggestions and not being listened to.<nl>Where it is vital that WADA intervenes it must rely on independent bodies, who have failed to be as unsparing as many would have hoped when bringing the Kremlin to book. Further to that, reinviting Russia's competitors to international competition under the guise of being ‘neutral athletes’ provides no evidence of any real repercussions for sport's most notorious doping scandal. What else could justify a ban on Russian athletes if a state-led doping programme cannot? As a direct result, sporting spirit often is forfeited in the blink of an eye, and it often appears that WADA's eyes are held shut due to their lack of authority. <nl><nl>Legalising doping is flawed<nl>It is only fair that critics of the current approach present alternative views about how doping can be better managed with the aim of promoting the spirit of sport. In that regard doping is difficult to regulate since most appropriate behaviours today can be considered as corrupt in the future. <nl>Some commentators recommend a supervised doping practise. There is a surplus of information on this subject which far exceeds the scope of this essay. The concept, though, can be narrowed down to a few key points: doping cannot be sufficiently safe as long as it is illegal, declaring that doping is unsafe becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy to some degree, since doping often occurs without adequate medical monitoring. They propose allowing medically controlled doping would provide a more solid basis for sports physicians to exercise their duty and fulfil their health-care obligations.<nl>While it is true that theories like principlism in medical ethics place high emphasis on autonomy and non-maleficence, and it is reasonable to believe that legalising doping could further these values, this essay argues that the dangers of controlled doping still outweigh the benefits. Indeed, these principles provide a method to define moral problems rather than provide answers. To begin with it is questionable whether more studies and funding on doping practises will lead to a lower risk to health. Despite decades of research live-saving drugs used to treat sepsis still carry high risks such as becoming deaf. As such, the proposal to minimise the risks associated with doping may be futile, since the current risks are already quite serious.<nl>It would also be difficult to define at what age someone can dope. The response is a proposal to prohibit competitive sports for children to avoid ethical dilemmas. This is obviously unrealistic, given that no nation will produce world class athletes unless young people participate in competitive sports. This moral dilemma is only complicated by athletes with pre-existing medical conditions. Sportspersons with polycystic kidney disease (PKD) have an inherited condition that causes numerous cysts in the kidneys. EPO, a common doping agent, is also produced in the kidneys. The problem is that EPO production is disrupted for these athletes, putting them at a disadvantage. Athletes with PKD would therefore suffer a great degree of inequality if EPO doping was legal. Anyone genetically predisposed to congenital heart condition (they are relatively common) could also be adversely affected by lots of performance enhancing drugs - by stressing the myocardium in such individuals they would be prone to potentially fatal arrhythmia. <nl>Therefore, it is argued that legalising a controlled doping practise would produce perhaps as much injustice as the current system. Sport can, however, proceed in several ways without facilitating the use of substances. The first sub-two-hour marathon ran by Eliud Kipchoge demonstrates how the use of mechanical help can produce new records. For cycling, athletes could use mechanically assisted bikes to help with hilly terrain. This is much safer than doping, however it is WADA that really needs to change.<nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>It has been argued that WADA’s actions have not contributed to the sporting spirit. WADA should have a much bigger say on the enforcement of the code, because its suggestions are often discarded by organisations for whom the spirt of sport is not always a significant objective. The proposal of controlled doping is not a suitable alternative. In the end, if the authors of the universal anti-doping rules are eventually made the ultimate arbiter, it will create an effective governing organisation with more power to actively ensure the spirit of sport.", "<addr2_FN>,<nl><nl>Just wanted to say thank you for your quick and helpful response.

{"id": "e62620df-6406-4b8a-8b09-61e684f94215", "discourse_types": ["memo", "email"], "pair": ["Regarding the information I have gathered for the CEO's trip to Helsinki, I have managed to find a multitude of things ranging from hotels to souvenir shops for her children. To start of with, the hotel I thought would be the best fit is the Radisson Blu Seaside Hotel, due to the fact it overlooks the scenic Gulf of Finland. The hotel further has access to gyms, saunas and serves traditional and fresh food, only for Â£74 pn. It is only 1.8 miles from the centre. The next place I found for the CEO to have breakfast was Karl Fazer CafÃ©, where they serve cinnamon buns and all sorts of savoury foods. It is local to the Hotel, being a 7 minute walk or a 5 minute car ride. Next, when looking at museums to explore, 2 stood out. One being, Sea Fortress Suomenlina. This stood out as it is near water, which is what Helsinki is known for, the sea, diverse architecture and their word famous designs. This sightseeing should be around 2-3 hours, and has many castles to visit including historical castles. The second was the Island and Open Air museum, this is more outdoor and is populated by many restaurants. This museum has been described as 'breath-taking', which is why it is also one that stood out. In regards to the souvenir shop, Kankufin Tapa was the highest rated one. This was because of the small homemade souvenirs, which can be easily to transport from different countries. For entertainment purposes, G-Livelab is the best place to go for live music, and for jazz. There is an event happening on the 4th September. Lastly, in relation to food, the restaurant that was highly rated was Kanstan Moljo. Though this is a buffet, it was highly rated because you can try a variety of traditional foods without having to commit to a whole meal. Additionally, it one of the few places that didn't serve solely salmon, there was alternatives such as reindeer meat, moose meat as well pork stew. These will allow for the CEO to not feel as though she is only faced with one option and that being seafood.", "lo,<nl><nl>Unfortunately, I lost the previous email, so again I am unsure on who to address the letter to.<nl><nl>Many thanks,<nl><part_FN><new>Hello,<nl><nl>I was wondering if I could  request an application form, in order to apply for the part time student telethon caller job.<nl><nl>Thank you<nl><part_FN><new>Hello,<nl><nl>I accept the offer.<nl><nl>Many thanks,<nl><part_FN><new>Hello,<nl><nl>I was wondering what theme <topic> would come under.<nl><nl>Many thanks<nl><part_FN><new>Hello,<nl><nl>I was wondering for  the presentation on <day>, will we be required to dress formal?<nl><nl>Many thanks<nl><part_FN><new>Hello,<nl><nl>I have attached the bibliography below.<nl><nl>Thank you <nl><part_FN> <new>Hello,<nl><nl> <nl><nl>Initially for my placement, I was meant to be going to <university>, however due to the covid-19 situation this has been cancelled.

{"id": "42ce8a6b-d551-4ab2-af6b-9ece13bd2634", "discourse_types": ["essay", "memo"], "pair": ["Pregnancy loss is often silenced and shamed whether it’s miscarriages, termination for medical reasons or stillborn deaths (Keane, 2009). This essay will focus specifically on miscarriages in the first trimester because of the stigma surrounding the validation of mourning a ‘human that didn’t exist’. This essay will also explore the discussions around motherhood, why women feel they are labelled ‘failed mothers’, and recommendations to reduce the stigma around early miscarriages.<nl>Motherhood has been the central and imperative role in a woman’s life. In a woman’s lifetime, she is expected to reproduce in order to fulfil the responsibility of ‘bearers of the collective’. The importance of being the ‘bearers of the collective’ ensures that reproduction allows society to function, and never ‘die out’. Because of this duty, these expectations have shaped women’s identities to believe all women will become mothers. Early miscarriages go against the concept of motherhood, and for this reason, there is stigmatisation around miscarriages. Stigma is defined as an ‘attribute that is deeply discrediting’ (Goffman, 1963:3), hence the shame and silence around miscarriages. Because of this stigma and duty placed on women, miscarriages deem women to be ‘failed mothers’.<nl>Many women believe they’ll have a successful pregnancy and start to prepare for the new addition. However, not all pregnancies are successful. In fact, ‘first trimester miscarriages are by far the most frequent type of pregnancy loss’ (Layne, 2000:325). When a miscarriage occurs, no one is to blame, however, the blame tends to fall on the woman (Abboud &amp; Liamputtong, 2002). Blame-shifting is a central factor of the stigmatisation around early miscarriages. The blame goes to the extent of the woman also accepting the blame, and believing she was the cause of the miscarriage (Miller, 2015). Moreover, the blame reinforces her inabilities as she renders herself incapable and questions whether something is wrong with her (Miller, 2015; Gerber-Epstein, et al., 2008). A study conducted by Abboud &amp; Liamputtong (2002) found that participants were blamed for their activities which allegedly caused their miscarriage. For example, a participant stated, \"They blame me that it’s my fault, that when I was pregnant, I was dancing, that I wasn’t eating properly. It’s my fault that this happened\" (2002:47). However, according to Sandford Health, it’s essential to exercise to combat the fatigue and hormonal changes during the first trimester (Seitz, 2019). Furthermore, the search for reasoning in early miscarriages causes blame-shifting on the woman, in which she accepts she has failed her duty to be the bearer of the collective, and essentially she is seen as a failed mother.<nl>As aforementioned, the blame allows the woman to accept the moral responsibility of the demise, but realistically she has failed an expectation which is uprooted in intensive motherhood. Intensive motherhood is the philosophy of maximising the potential of a person to become a better version of themselves. In this case, women have adapted to this belief through the understanding of gender roles. Gender roles have set in stone that women are to be housewives and mothers, and from a young age, girls are taught how to cook and nurture. A participant stated that \"the illusion is created not during the pregnancy, but when we are small girls, when we’re still playing with dolls, we already think about being mothers, about children, because it’s in our nature\" (Gerber-Epstein, et al., 2008:16). The bonding with dolls maximises the potential for young girls to become mothers in the future. In addition, the act of bonding is extended in pregnancy which develops attachment between the woman and the foetus. However, miscarriages interrupt the bonding process that women have adopted since they were young, leaving them confused and empty. The impact of intensive motherhood allows women to develop the ‘picture-perfect’ family idea and believe having children fulfils their purpose of being a woman. In essence, the woman’s identity is defined by her ability to conceive. <nl>The intensive motherhood belief also implies that women have to become mothers, and this contributes to the reason why women try again after a miscarriage to maintain the responsibility of the bearer of the collective. A husband of a participant in the Abboud &amp; Liamputtong study said that \"she kept trying…she insisted…she wanted a boy, like all the other women\" and this was due to his wife feeling she needed a baby to please her husband (2002:54). This implies that miscarriages make women feel they’re inadequate wivespartners, as well as inadequate women, and in order to change that, they must conceive. This also echoes the discussion that motherhood validates a woman’s place in society. Becoming a mother makes a woman an accepted person in society and even in her family home. All in all, intensive motherhood prepares women for the position they play in society – which is to become mothers. Until they do so, they’re ‘failed mothers’ or ‘deviant women’. <nl>Intensive motherhood works symbiotically with the policing of women’s bodies and behaviours. The first trimester of pregnancies is labelled as the ‘risky period’ (first 12 weeks) because this is when early miscarriages occur. For this reason, women are told to not get ‘too excited’ until the first trimester has passed. This period controls the woman’s experience of pregnancy due to biomedical framings. Rothman quoted in Ross (2015) states that ‘demands are placed on women to emotionally distance themselves from the pregnancy, and suspend experiences of attachment to the foetus until ‘it is deemed worth keeping’. For first time pregnancies, holding in excitement is almost impossible, therefore this biomedical framing creates a sense of uncertainty. Shildrick quoted in Ross (2015) argues that women’s bodies have been labelled as inferior. This implies that medical input has superiority over the woman’s body and makes it their obligation to know what’s right for her. Due to the ‘risky period’, women tend to keep the news to themselves and remain quiet about their pregnancy. Additionally, because of stigmatisation around early miscarriages, women refrain from announcing the news of their pregnancy to avoid announcing that they miscarried, and this is to avoid felt stigma and the actual stigma itself. Furthermore, women felt that society’s conventions around hiding a pregnancy until after the first trimester meant they felt alone and isolated in their feelings (Bellhouse, et al., 2018:7). Overall, the biomedical framings have created a scare around the first trimester in order to avoid the stigmatisation of being labelled a failed mother.<nl>Policing of women’s behaviours and bodies has become a routinized process, and women themselves believe every medical input is necessary during the pregnancy. During pregnancy, women are told what to eat and drink, especially at antenatal appointments. Undoubtedly, antenatal appointments have the intention of ensuring the health of the woman and the baby is prioritised, but there are elements of policing and monitoring her behaviours. For a first time pregnancy, up to 10 antenatal appointments are expected, and 7 for those who have had a child already (NHS, 2020), and these appointments ‘feature detailed discussions of women’s behaviours and encouragement to modify those seen as posing a risk to the pregnancy’ (Ross, 2015:330). These modifications allow women to think that if she doesn’t follow these rules, she is the cause of the miscarriage. In fact, most women follow the instructions of pregnancy, yet many still suffer miscarriages in the first trimester. These instructions imply that medical attention plays their part to also maximise the potential of a woman becoming a mother. Over time, women’s bodies have become the embodiment of distrust therefore medical attention during pregnancy is a core contribution to the transition from womanhood to motherhood, to avoid having a miscarriage. In brevity, if these rules are followed, it’s believed there are slim chances of miscarriages, and if they aren’t followed, a woman causes her miscarriage and she is a failed mother.<nl>The ‘risky period’ (12 weeks of gestation) can pose implications that the foetus isn’t an actual human until birth, therefore mourning a miscarriage tends to be unrecognised. The validity of the foetus can be discussed through the concept of foetal personhood. Foetal personhood raises questions in the validation of a woman’s loss as some would regard the foetus as ‘medical waste’. Martel’s study (2014) found that in Canada, pregnancies ending under 20 weeks gestation andor under the birth weight of 500 grams are not registered with Statistics Canada or issued a birth or death certificate. This indicates that foetuses shouldn’t be honoured like newborn babies, due to the fact that ‘miscarriage is not socially recognised in the same way that the loss of a born baby or family member might be’ (Bellhouse, et al., 2018:2).<nl>Medical technologies, such as ultrasounds and sonograms encourage the foetus to be seen as ‘real’, from a foetus to a baby. These technologies allow women to become attached to the foetus, and when the miscarriage occurs, the woman feels a great loss due to the bonding formed in the first trimester, and accept that the pregnancy loss is also real. In reality, some women don’t know they’re pregnant until they take pregnancy tests. They can assume the miscarriage is a delayed period, but the role of medical technologies encourages women to think of their ‘wished-for child as a person’ (Layne quoted in Keane 2009). Similarly, the assumption of the mother role is strengthened by hospital visits and medical technologies because the woman assumes she is a mother. The definition of a mother is \"a woman in relation to a child or children to whom she has given birth to\" (Oxford English Dictionary, 2002), and in the case of early miscarriages, this raises questions as to whether the woman who miscarried can mourn as if she were a mother. Nevertheless, whether the woman should be seen as a mother or not, the imagining of the child-to-be should validate her reasoning to feel the loss. The ‘construction of the ‘child’ is created by social actors (the parents) whose identities are shaped by being in a family relationship with them, and without this construction, the ‘child’ cannot exist’ (Mullin, 2015:32). Moreover, Mullin (2015) argues that although the foetus didn’t reach its full potential, it had the potential to do so, therefore the loss of a miscarried foetus should be recognised. Undeniably, the part medical technologies play in foetal personhood reinforces early miscarriages as a failure. The dismissal of recognition for miscarried foetuses further embodies that women who miscarry are failed mothers, as their miscarried foetus isn’t commemorated and is seen as ‘medical waste’.<nl>As previously mentioned, early miscarriages are regarded as medical waste, which invalidates the woman’s grief. The woman’s emotions during and after the miscarriage can be strengthened by her friends, family and medical staff by showing a lack of support, which further emphasises the woman labelled as a failed mother. Bellhouse’s study (2018) found that previous research shows that women affected by miscarriages feel a lack of recognition of their loss, as well as emotional support from those close to them. It is understandable that the woman’s support bubble may not understand her loss, but the emotional distance makes the woman feel alone. Some people around the woman encourage her to ‘get over it’ and forget about it, and urge her to try again. In Gerber-Epstein’s study (2008), a woman’s family had the tendency to insist her to return back to normality and try again. Another woman in the study recalled a doctor saying \"…you’ve got nothing to worry about, you’ll have a bleed in a few days.\" (2008:11). In Abboud &amp; Liamputtong’s study (2002), a woman’s husband said \"…the doctor said a couple of weeks and back to normal life and you can have a baby next month\" (2002:47). The lack of recognition of the woman’s grief and healing is prevalent around early miscarriages, which downplays her mourning. These quotes also reveal that women have to constantly work on fulfilling the responsibility of the bearers of the collective, despite what may be going on around them.<nl>Women who have suffered early miscarriages feel shame and embarrassment from their social circle. Some go as far as making insensitive comments and finding the silver lining in the miscarriage. In Bellhouse’s study, they found that \"approximately half of the women expressed feeling that others often did not understand their experience and therefore struggled to empathise with them and support them at the time of their miscarriage, leading to feelings of hurt and disappointment\"(2018:5). People said to a participant in Bellhouse’s study \"oh you know, you’ll get pregnant again’, or, um, ‘oh it was meant to be\" (2018:6). Apart from the insensitive comments, people found ways to blame women for their life choices and activities (e.g. working too hard) as a reason for the miscarriage (Bellhouse, et al., 2018). The shame and embarrassment also extend to women over the age of 30 that miscarry. Although there is no set age for childbearing, it is believed that childbearing rates start to fall low in women over the age of 30 (Noord-Zaadstra, et al., 1991). In Abboud &amp; Liamputtong’s study, a participant’s husband stated \"…she was crazy to get pregnant again. In her mind she was too old, and it’s very hard to get pregnant again with her age and menopause\" (2002:53). The woman in the study was between the ages of 37-38, yet she felt she had to prove to her husband her capability to become a mother. Furthermore, this reveals older women experience the stigma of being a failed mother, seeing as they’re nearing the age of menopause. The lack of support from family and friends of the woman suffering from the miscarriage strengthens her label as a ‘failed mother’ as many fail to legitimise her feelings, instead they urge her to try again, rather than allowing her to grieve and heal.<nl>The aftermath of early miscarriages makes women experience feelings such as helplessness, sadness, guilt, irritability, repeated recollection of the experience and fear (Walker &amp; Davidson quoted in Gerber-Epstein, et al., 2008). Many women who experience an early miscarriage feel they’re worthless, disabled, and inadequate (Gerber-Epstein, et al., 2008; Ross, 2015). During this period, women can become envious of other women with children because it reminds them that they’re failed mothers (Gerber-Epstein, et al., 2008). Moreover, women feel they have disappointed themselves and everyone around them. Some women go as far as opting for tubal ligation and adoption seeing as they’re unable to conceive. A woman revealed she and her partner were planning tubal ligation to prevent future pregnancies as she had suffered seven miscarriages (Abboud &amp; Liamputtong, 2002). Similarly, another woman said \"I was already thinking I ought to adopt a child, because I already said I wouldn’t be able to have children\" (Gerber-Epstein, et al., 2008:15). These women have accepted that they are failed mothers due to the frequency of miscarriages, and settle for alternatives. Women who have experienced early miscarriages often feel scared to get pregnant again, because they feel that their future pregnancies will result in early miscarriages. Overall, these feelings remind women of what they’re not – which is a mother. Early miscarriages also remind them that they have defied the transition from womanhood to motherhood, and they have failed the duty of the bearers of the collective.  <nl>These feelings tend to go unnoticed and untreated by the woman’s support bubble and medical staff, and if left ignored, it can haunt the woman for a long time (Frost, et al., 2007). It’s important that women who have suffered early miscarriages feel they’re not failed mothers, neither are they alone. In regards to family and friends, it’s important for them to speak about the miscarriage so the woman isn’t the only one acknowledging the loss. A woman and her husband found that speaking about the miscarriage helped her grieving process (Abboud &amp; Liamputtong, 2002), and women who spoke to other women who had miscarried felt it helped them (Bellhouse, et al., 2018). It’s also vital that the woman’s family and friends are willing to listen to her, and allow her to mourn at her own pace (Bellhouse, et al., 2018; Gerber-Epstein, et al., 2008). Creating memories are just as important because it acknowledges the loss, rather than forgetting the miscarriage. A couple found it helpful to take their miscarried babies to their house to create memories and reminders (Abboud &amp; Liamputtong, 2002). Other women found comfort in commemorating their miscarriage through pregnancy loss websites where the miscarried children are represented in the form of angels (Keane, 2009).<nl>Medical care needs to devote time for counselling and support for women after miscarriages to help them process the miscarriage, as well as being sensitive and reassuring (Abboud &amp; Liamputtong, 2002; Gerber-Epstein, et al., 2008). Women also feel medical care should provide more information and knowledge on miscarriages so women understand how common it is (Frost, et al., 2007; Bellhouse, et al., 2018). In addition, society needs to acknowledge the loss so women don’t feel stigmatised. Suggestions such as public speeches, talks, and medical conferences can lessen the silence around early miscarriages (Frost, et al., 2007). Most importantly, it’s important to stop the blame-shifting onto women who miscarry (Frost, et al., 2007), and to stop the tradition of secrecy during the first trimester of pregnancy (the ‘risky period’). These recommendations will help women know they’re not failed mothers. Educating society and women’s support bubbles will improve the healing process for women.<nl>In conclusion, society’s expectations for women as bearers of the collective has allowed women to believe they’re failed mothers when they miscarry. The culture of blame-shifting contributes to women feeling invalidated until they become mothers. The lack of emotional and physical support following an early miscarriage emphasises the silence and stigmatisation around it. In order to overcome this, more information needs to be provided to society and women affected, to reassure them that they are not failed mothers.", "Dear Ms, I have organised an itinerary for your upcoming trip to Helsinki on the 2nd to the 4th of September. Your hotel is the Hotel Haven which is located on Unioninkatu 17, near the south harbour and is a 3 minute walk to the Market Square. This is at a cost of Â£157 per night. You will be dining at Cafe Roasberg for breakfast which is located on Mikonkatu 13. Next, the Helsinki City Museum will allow you to look at the history of Helsinki. This is on Aleksanterinkatu 16. In order to purchase traditional souvenirs, I would direct you to Shop Helsinki - Mikebon which is on Simonkatu 9. For dinner, you will be eating at Restaurant Lappi which is on Annankatu 22. They serve the national dish which is sautÃ©ed reindeer. Finally for the evening, there is a live music venue called On the Rocks which have live music every night from different global bands. This is located on Mikonkatu 15. All items in the itinerary are within walking distance of the hotel, up to 15 minutes, but there is the option to take a short journey on public transport if looking to instead. I wish you a good trip. Kind regards, Olivia James"]}

The data was rectified in order to turn the negative values into positive so that the average signal strength (µV) was shown rather than the range. The data was averaged over 50 samples using Biopac’s ‘Integrate’ feature which allowed for the graph curves to be smoother and clearer. The rectification and integration of the data was necessary so that an accurate mean could be taken for each condition. These new rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA) were used for the rest of the data analysis. <nl><nl>Descriptive &amp; inferential statistics<nl>Table 1.<nl><table><nl>Table 1 shows that the mean of the eyes open condition was lower than the eyes closed condition. There was not a large amount of variance of data across the means (see Table 1). The eyes open condition had a smaller variance than the eyes closed, as the standard deviation was closer to the mean in this condition. The Chi² test suggests that the frequencies of the RAAA are significantly different in the eyes open and closed conditions (Chi² = 12.500, df = 1, p &lt; .01). The RAAA frequency was 26 in the eyes closed condition and 6 in the eyes open condition, so the means are consistent with the RAAA frequencies. <nl><nl>To summarise, the results show that there is a difference between the RAAA frequencies of the eyes open and eyes closed conditions. These results were expected as brain rhythms differ when eyes are open or closed (Barry et al., 2007).<nl><nl>Reflection<nl>I have achieved a general understanding of physiological measurement using Biopac from conducting this study, as I have learnt how to use the system to rectify and integrate data in order for it to be more understandable to analyse. As a group, we found the placement of the electrodes using the international 1020 positioning system fairly difficult, as it wasn’t particularly clear where exactly to place them on the scalp. We had to change the positioning of the electrodes and remove the dead skin from the scalp a few times until the impedance was low enough to continue the rest of the experiment. I didn’t enjoy placing the electrodes on the participant’s scalp and measuring the distance between the nasion and the inion because both tasks were meticulous and required a lot of patience. However, I did enjoy using Biopac to rectify the data in order to see clearly the brainwaves of the participant and how it correlated with whether their eyes were open or closed. In order to improve the experiment, I would reduce the number of confounding variables by ensuring the participant wasn’t blinking, talking or chewing during the experiment, as these artifacts may have had an impact on the data used for analysis. Additionally, I would have ensured the experiment took part in a quiet room away from other people as it is more likely for the brainwave activity to be due to whether the participant’s eyes were open or closed rather than distractions.<nl>", "y better than they was earlier<new>Yeye maybe<new>But I think they ok<new>Booking train tix to arrive on <DDth> <month_abbr> at 2pm and arrive back to <city> by 5:15 on <day><new>Ok, do u mean go to <city> on <DD><DDth> ?<new>Or u go to <city><new>Ohhhh okay makes sense<new>Ye sounds bless<new>Awh he loves my wardrobe<new>Is he back yet?<new>Dw he'll be fine<new>🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺<new>Soz was showering<new>Ooooohhh awh<new>Arrives at <station> at 1:41pm<new>Yeye dw<new>Meet at <station> and wander around!<new>Um ok<new>Okr<new>Meet at <station><new>And I don't mind going anywhere<new>Pls dony😂😭<new>Leave at 820"]}

{"id": "d2919a5d-b839-4f35-8e3a-63dbf613369a", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["The introduction to this essay will explain doping as a form of corruption and will cite statistics to convey the extent of its effect on sport. This will be accompanied by an examination of what the spirit of sport is. This essay's critical debate aims to expose WADA's ineffectiveness in ensuring that the spirit of sport triumphs over the doping corruption. In this regard, WADA's loose grip on national and sport’s governing bodies can be seen to disrupt clean athletes. The debate then will shift to how WADA's code is fundamentally discriminatory against athletes from developing countries, causing less privileged athletes to face harsher realities for the committing the same offences as their contestants. These problems are exacerbated by corruption in different countries where the punishments handed down by authorities do not reflect the crimes. The eventual finding is that WADA is unsuccessful because it lacks necessary authority. This essay will also offer a critique of the proposal of legalised doping, shedding light on its shortcomings. It will be concluded that an increase in WADA’s power is required for the spirit of sport. The conclusion is that WADA will only be able to promote the spirit of sport effectively when they are the final arbiter in enforcing the code. This essay includes insights from Sports science, medicine, sociology, ethics, psychology and economics to support its claims.<nl>Corruption is defined as ‘dishonest or illegal behaviour, especially of people in authority’. Gorse and Chadwick suggest corruption in sport includes illegal, immoral or non-ethical activities, which intentionally seek to distort the outcome of a sports competition for one or more parties' personal benefit. , Gorse and Chadwick analysed 2,089 cases of corruption in sports, where doping was present in 95.64% of cases.<nl>The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) is responsible for leading a collaborative worldwide movement for doping-free sport. They stress that anti-doping programmes foster the ‘spirit of sport’ which includes values like ethics, joy, education, health and fair play. According to the World Anti-Doping Code (WADC), doping is contrary to the spirit of sport, so impressions of sporting achievement are important. When an athlete achieves success, it is helpful that their performances are not overshadowed by scepticism. The Sport of cycling can be used as an example.<nl>Reeth and Lagae surveyed if doping was acceptable among different demographics in the cycling community. They reported a clear view that doping contradicts the spirit of fair play. When Chris Froome became the first Briton to win the Tour de France twice, his second victory was marred by doping allegations. Froome was eventually proven innocent, but there is no doubt that the distrust created by Lance Armstrong made public scepticism inescapable for anyone that proceeded him. From a sociological point of view, this proves that the social significance of any sport is heavily reliant on its winning athletes. These winners are currently expected to work honestly for their accomplishments. This might be done by training hard simply with a special talent. However, the vital spirit of sport is undermined if the organisation which regulates anti-doping is unsuccessful in doing so.<nl>It is very possible that chalking Armstrong’s wins did nothing to solve the problems he created. When he became the first cycling colossus, he grew to establish a legacy that would see his accomplishments rise in importance as the sport's history evolves and more athletes fail to better him. That became a double-edged sword when anti-doping campaigns erased these victories, thus profoundly undermining the sport's past and underlying spirit. A relentless scepticism of innocent winners could also turn athletes away from the sport, fearing the scrutiny their lives would face if they had any success. Surely any failure to solve this issue could damage the spirit of a sport and this failure can be traced back to WADA?<nl><nl>Clean athletes often lose out<nl>The WADC exists to maintain a fundamental right to compete in doping-free competition. This is why, if the WADC fails, any athlete who competes clean suffers the consequences. It is often the case that those who win are recalled, occasionally with a thought for second and third place, while those who finish below the podium positions sometimes fade into obscurity. These individuals forfeit the life-changing status and wealth that comes with success because they miss out on awards to dishonest athletes who dope. It is therefore important WADA ensures ‘clean athletes don’t suffer the devastation of stolen medal moments’. <nl>Unfortunately, many athletes have already been affected by this calamity. The Associated Press estimated that $410,000 could be owed to thousands of athletes because of only four track and field players who never returned their prize money from the Olympic Games after being caught doping.  Athletes are also sometimes given a cash sum by their country for placing well in a sporting event. Moreover, those that do not make it to the podium are deprived of recognition; Jo Pavey, who finished fourth in the 10,000m at the 2007 World Championships, was still waiting for her bronze medal nearly a decade later. <nl>When it comes to fixing these injustices, WADA loses out just as much. Appeals to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) can currently be made to recover an athlete’s losses, but the views of CAS rarely align with WADA’s recommendations. On top of that CAS also risks having its own decisions set aside by the Swiss Federal Court. The current format then receives criticism because many of its legal efforts have focused disproportionately on the suspected athlete’s right to fair process, meaning they fail to provide clean athletes with the attention they deserve. On the other hand, there are reasons why suspected athletes deserve reasonable legal process, such as mitigating factors. Goalkeeper Andre Onana was recently suspended for mistakenly taking a painkiller that turned out to be a banned substance. Although it is the athletes' duty to ensure that no banned substance enters their bodies, ignoring defendants entirely in favour of clean athletes does not seem like the most reasonable alternative. <nl>That being said, allowing implicated athletes from Russia to compete in the 2016 Olympics, did nothing to convey any consequences of doping on a national scale. When the IOC refused to follow any of WADA's guidelines on Russia it showed a blatant disregard for the spirit of sport and for the right to compete in doping-free sport. Likewise, the decisions of CAS have been criticised for being inconsistent and still allowing corrupt athletes to participate. Despite CAS’ shortcomings, it is nevertheless the responsibility of the WADC to provide guidance on these matters, but rules for state endorsed doping did not exist at the time. Critics have argued that not addressing that issue was ‘… the most detrimental aspect of the Code’.<nl>One might then argue WADA's inability to protect all athletes who participate clean does not imply that they are the sole culprit, since this would set an impossibly high standard for WADA. However, when the authors of the universal anti-doping rule do not agree with the enforcers, it creates a divide between the different anti-doping authorities to the detriment of any clean athlete. More recently it was reported that WADA has opened a formal investigation into UK Anti-Doping for enabling British Cycling to conduct its own investigation into one of its riders. This supports the idea that WADA's lack of authority when imposing the spirit of sport is frequently amplified by the missteps of National and Sports Governing Bodies.<nl><nl>There is not a ‘level playing field’<nl>It may also be argued that the current anti-doping approach does not account for the differences caused by the various settings in which athletes live. This means there is not a fair playing field in sport. Firstly, it is not considered an unfair advantage to live in a wealthy country, yet athletes that do have a significant edge over their rivals from developing countries. Kayser and others argue that these conditions can sometimes come close to doping. <nl>Scholars from developing countries have argued that reaching a world class status in sports often reflects excellent equipment and facilities. Despite this, sport is not a top priority in any developing state. Research suggests that these countries instead rely on imported goods and sponsorships to provide amenities. The outcome is that athletes cannot become involved in ‘sophisticated doping’ in the same way as their competitors since they often lack the resources. Sports facilities in emergent countries are often not maintained because of their financial costs. Consequently, their usage is reduced which leads to a smaller number of local sports competitions. Further, UNESCO suggested in 2013 that there were considerable widespread shortfalls in the quality and quantity of facility and amenity provision, especially in low income countries. For that reason it would be absurd to conclude that talents from developing nations are ever really on a fair playing field, even from a young age. <nl>Corruption in developing countries such as Kenya only compounds these issues. WADA recognised that the doping practices of Kenyan athletes are ‘unsophisticated, opportunistic, and uncoordinated’. This is because testing techniques for older, well-known substances such as Erythropoietin (EPO) are well established meaning its users are easier to spot. The problem is that anti-doping tests are not equally as effective for athletes with access to newer substances. The comparatively unsophisticated doping practises of Kenyan athletes means they are typically caught, and therefore penalised, more often than their competition. This goes to show that a level playing field hardly ever exists.<nl>Operation Aderlass demonstrated these problems in action. In endurance sports, autologous blood doping (ABD), which allows athletes to supply more oxygen to their muscles, has been a big advantage for athletes until discovery., Only then did endurance athletes own up to doing it, probably because they felt that they would be singled out eventually. By contrast, some of Kenya’s highest profile athletes have been identified and banned from their sports because their doping practises were easier to identify. This demonstrates that not all cheaters are treated equally, not because some have committed more serious crimes than others, but because they are committing the same crime with less success.<nl>It may be argued that the nature of this imbalance seriously undermines whether anti-doping efforts are worthwhile and whether they help the spirit of sport. However, it is unfair to expect authorities to always be on top of doping. Still, WADA's anti-doping programmes aim to maintain sport's level playing field. When only certain athletes can use doping to their advantage, these ideals are damaged. As a result of this inequality, talented athletes from developed countries are forced to pursue other opportunities, and the sport suffers the consequences. Ultimately the disparity in doping practises also creates confusion around winners, making it difficult for people to trust whether achievements are the result of hard work or corruption. These are problems that WADA must resolve if it wants to restore confidence in the spirit of sport and offer better opportunities to athletes from developing countries who may risk being left behind if they compete clean.<nl><nl>WADA cannot enforce consequences<nl>'Operation Puerto' in Spain exemplified how WADA has frequently been obstructed in addressing its concerns. Multiple athletes were involved in this sandal. The Criminal Court of Madrid ruled that the evidence discovered by police should be destroyed, a verdict that WADA later challenged. Its former director general, David Howman, argued that ‘at times it seemed as if the intention was to delay any proper approach’. WADA were also unable to name the implicated athletes due to their own statute of limitations policy. <nl>The inability to reveal these facts proves that perceptions of achievement can sometimes be distorted to shield athletes at all costs. In the 2000s, Spanish athletes were worshiped as long as they continued to make Spain a sporting powerhouse (Soule and Kudovic 2011). Dr Fuentes confessed that his clients included athletes from many different sports. One might then argue that Spain and WADA still bear the same burden as in 2006: exposing the facts. A failure to do so not only casts doubt on those in power, but it also calls into question their ability to enforce the WADC. As a consequence, one might argue the values enshrined in the spirit of sport are abandoned at the price of one country.<nl>The implications of Operation Puerto still pale in comparison to those of Russia's state-led anti-doping regime. It involved the director of the anti-doping laboratory in Russia creating a mixture of banned substances that he gave to dozens of Russian athletes, enabling the most controversial doping scheme in history. While WADA endorsed a ban of 4 years, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) substituted a 2 year ban. It also repealed a WADA provision that would have forced Russian athletes to make clear that they were not involved with the scheme. The US anti-doping agency chief suggested the ruling was ‘a catastrophic blow to clean athletes, the integrity of sport, and the rule of law.’<nl>For many this has made it clear that WADA is a substandard organisation when it comes to enforcing its own code. In many countries, WADA must depend on the authorities' willingness to implement effective anti-doping policies and it is clear this scarcely happens. Furthermore, the implementation of the code is contingent governing bodies’ ability to punish the guilty parties for their violations of the code. Instead, these organisations often fall short of their responsibilities, raising doubts about their ability to enforce the code in light of the spirit of sport. This can only come back to bite WADA who are trapped in a vicious circle of making suggestions and not being listened to.<nl>Where it is vital that WADA intervenes it must rely on independent bodies, who have failed to be as unsparing as many would have hoped when bringing the Kremlin to book. Further to that, reinviting Russia's competitors to international competition under the guise of being ‘neutral athletes’ provides no evidence of any real repercussions for sport's most notorious doping scandal. What else could justify a ban on Russian athletes if a state-led doping programme cannot? As a direct result, sporting spirit often is forfeited in the blink of an eye, and it often appears that WADA's eyes are held shut due to their lack of authority. <nl><nl>Legalising doping is flawed<nl>It is only fair that critics of the current approach present alternative views about how doping can be better managed with the aim of promoting the spirit of sport. In that regard doping is difficult to regulate since most appropriate behaviours today can be considered as corrupt in the future. <nl>Some commentators recommend a supervised doping practise. There is a surplus of information on this subject which far exceeds the scope of this essay. The concept, though, can be narrowed down to a few key points: doping cannot be sufficiently safe as long as it is illegal, declaring that doping is unsafe becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy to some degree, since doping often occurs without adequate medical monitoring. They propose allowing medically controlled doping would provide a more solid basis for sports physicians to exercise their duty and fulfil their health-care obligations.<nl>While it is true that theories like principlism in medical ethics place high emphasis on autonomy and non-maleficence, and it is reasonable to believe that legalising doping could further these values, this essay argues that the dangers of controlled doping still outweigh the benefits. Indeed, these principles provide a method to define moral problems rather than provide answers. To begin with it is questionable whether more studies and funding on doping practises will lead to a lower risk to health. Despite decades of research live-saving drugs used to treat sepsis still carry high risks such as becoming deaf. As such, the proposal to minimise the risks associated with doping may be futile, since the current risks are already quite serious.<nl>It would also be difficult to define at what age someone can dope. The response is a proposal to prohibit competitive sports for children to avoid ethical dilemmas. This is obviously unrealistic, given that no nation will produce world class athletes unless young people participate in competitive sports. This moral dilemma is only complicated by athletes with pre-existing medical conditions. Sportspersons with polycystic kidney disease (PKD) have an inherited condition that causes numerous cysts in the kidneys. EPO, a common doping agent, is also produced in the kidneys. The problem is that EPO production is disrupted for these athletes, putting them at a disadvantage. Athletes with PKD would therefore suffer a great degree of inequality if EPO doping was legal. Anyone genetically predisposed to congenital heart condition (they are relatively common) could also be adversely affected by lots of performance enhancing drugs - by stressing the myocardium in such individuals they would be prone to potentially fatal arrhythmia. <nl>Therefore, it is argued that legalising a controlled doping practise would produce perhaps as much injustice as the current system. Sport can, however, proceed in several ways without facilitating the use of substances. The first sub-two-hour marathon ran by Eliud Kipchoge demonstrates how the use of mechanical help can produce new records. For cycling, athletes could use mechanically assisted bikes to help with hilly terrain. This is much safer than doping, however it is WADA that really needs to change.<nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>It has been argued that WADA’s actions have not contributed to the sporting spirit. WADA should have a much bigger say on the enforcement of the code, because its suggestions are often discarded by organisations for whom the spirt of sport is not always a significant objective. The proposal of controlled doping is not a suitable alternative. In the end, if the authors of the universal anti-doping rules are eventually made the ultimate arbiter, it will create an effective governing organisation with more power to actively ensure the spirit of sport.", "<nl><nl>Thanks for getting back to me.

{"id": "d7f219d8-3489-4fb3-b96c-69c7918414be", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Faces are vital in conveying emotions and allowing humans to nonverbally interact with each other (Little et al., 2011). It also allows us to distinguish other social drivers such as power, attractiveness, and personality traits, just from a glimpse (Zebrowitz, 2017). Regarding emotion, there has been an ongoing debate to see to what extent facial displays of emotion are universal. With more research coming into the light, arguments have been swayed to not support the idea of universality.<nl><nl>To ‘correctly’ recognise emotion from a facial display can be considered subjective, as one person will not perceive emotion in the same manner as another. Yet some studies have shown the ‘happy’ facial display to be the most correctly recognized facial display out of the proposed seven (Mishra et al., 2018; West et al., 2012). Difficulties come into play when there are a variety of smiles from a ‘happy’ face that can be distinguished (Frank, 2002). This comes to question on the universality of emotions in faces. <nl>This leads on to explain the theoretical models that have been proposed to refute the universality theory of emotions in facial displays. The behavioural ecology view of facial displays (BECV) is one theory from an array of theoretical models which takes the stance against the universality thesis (Crivelli &amp; Fridlund, 2018). It claims that the emotions we express through our faces are a ‘social tool’, meaning that we use our face to nonverbally interact and elicit reactions from humans. The theory had also recognised that facial displays of emotion will vary across different environments, this notion was supported by Crivelli’s own study in the Trobriand Island, where he had found low levels of correct recognition on all five of the facial displays by the Trobrianders (Crivelli et al., 2017).<nl><nl>Further research that supports the BECV has often looked at how facial recognition of emotion differs between culture; the significance of Ekman’s work in cross-cultural studies tends to be cited around this topic. However, with more research around emotion becoming apparent, new studies tend to have a different perspective on Ekman’s study. For instance, in one of his studies, he had reported that the Fore Tribe tended to select the 'surprised' photograph 67% of the time when a story about ‘someone feeling fearful’ was told (Ekman &amp; Friesen, 1971). Dailey et al (2010) had found the same result in his study but brought a different angle to the table. He had used Japanese and American participants rather than a small-scale indigenous society; the Japanese participants tended to sway more towards the surprised face when it was a fear face being presented on the screen.<nl><nl>Dailey et al’s (2010) main conclusion on this result was it initially came down to cultural differences, as the Japanese and the Fore tribe have different social contexts compared to the westerners. But specifically, he went to mention in his discussion that Japanese people tend to not fear strangers as much as Americans do (Matsumoto, 1988). In this case, Japanese people would not view the fear facial expression as occasionally in their daily life as Americans, this would therefore explain why they did not correctly identify a ‘fear’ facial display in the tasks when it was presented. Hence, it can be argued that social contexts will affect one’s perceptions of recognising facial displays of emotions.<nl><nl>Nevertheless, studies like the ones mentioned above tend to use facial displays that exaggerate the emotion however, in real life emotions tend to not be expressed in such a ‘cartoon-like’ way, instead, they are more subtle and sometimes even morphed with other emotions. With this being said evidence still shows that there are cultural differences in identifying subtle facial expressions. In a recent study by Zhang et al (2014), they had found that Americans were better at judging subtle negative emotions (angry and sad) than Chinese participants. It is said that this occurs because it is common for Chinese people to express their negative emotions more outwardly, as subtle negative facial expressions might hinder their interpersonal harmony in their society (Matsumoto 1989; Matsumoto and Ekman 1989; Matsumoto et al., 2008). So, subtle negative emotions such as ‘anger’ and ‘sad’ would not be recognised in facial expressions. In essence, this still supports the fact that there are cultural differences regardless of facial expressions being presented in a more subtle or overemphasised manner.  <nl><nl>The studies above clearly emphasize the fact that facial recognition of emotions cannot be universal, as there are significant differences when both cultures were identifying emotions from faces; this comes down to differences in cultural context as they vary in \"social ideologies and practices of the cultural groups\" (Jack et al., 2012). This comes in line to support the BECV theory, as both studies highlight that context is important and impacts a person in identifying emotions from facial expressions.<nl><nl>The cross-cultural studies mentioned above might have some limitations, for example, they tend to only follow an etic approach as researchers will usually be outside of the culture they are studying, which might mean valuable detail in communication could be lost in translation sometimes (Buil et al., 2012). Accordingly, converging neurological studies helps in the understanding of how the brain affects behaviour regardless of social context; so, research in this area would not be impacted by an etic or emic approach, which would help in further understanding why facial recognition of emotion is not universal. <nl><nl>In opposition to the BECV theory, Ekman had proposed an outdated ‘Basic emotions theory’ (BET) which followed a more Darwinian approach. It emphasised that facial expressions of emotion are a biological process and is hardwired, with seven basic emotions that humans can express and identify from (Ekman and Friesen, 1969); therefore, it can show a universal pattern in recognising facial displays of emotion regardless of social context. <nl><nl>The field of neuropsychology has challenged the BET by stating that facial recognition of emotion is not as hardwired and biological as it seems. In regard to the Haxby et model (2000), it has stated that facial perception occurs in the core system (superior temporal sulcus) and then further expands into the extended system in where the amygdala will be able to process emotion from faces. This model is supported by Foley et al’s study (2012) as it found an increase in activity levels of the bilateral STS and the amygdala when perceiving emotions from facial expressions. <nl><nl>The universality thesis comes to be challenged when impairments in the amygdala occur; when the amygdala is impaired there are significant differences that are seen in the processing of negative emotions (Whalen et al., 2013). This will be further examined by looking into individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), as they display an atypical amygdala (Kliemann et al., 2012). A study that had shown this had used Ekman and Friesen’s (1976) series of facial displays in an upright and inverted manner, to witness if ASD individuals identified emotions differently (Wallace et al., 2008). They had found that people with ASD were significantly worse at identifying facial displays in both upright and inverted conditions, they had even tended to misidentify 'fear' for 'anger'. This was similarly seen in Ashwin et al’s (2006) study where ASD individuals were more impaired on emotions such as ‘fear’, ‘anger’ and ‘disgust’. This shows that impairment in the amygdala does affect how ASD individuals perceive emotion in faces. <nl><nl>Black et al (2017) had argued that behaviour studies are not able to localise where the difficulty lies in the brain of ASD individuals, so we cannot assume correlation will imply causation. Instead, neuroimaging studies will provide us with the neural specificity to locate what parts of the brain that actually cause this disruption. Hence, a review had examined a variety of neurological studies and had found an association between the amygdala in ASD people and facial emotion recognition (Harms et al., 2010). A supporting study had used a functional magnetic resonance imaging and found that ASD adults had a greater right amygdala activation when viewing facial displays, than neurotypical adults (Monk et al., 2010). <nl><nl>In addition, this evidence can expand to further diagnosis’ such as people with encephalitis, who also have severe amygdala damage; they tend to show the same recognition as ASD individuals with identifying fear and disgust (Sprengelmeyer, 1998). This has been further highlighted in Broks et al (1998) study, where the individuals had difficulties identifying fear in a facial emotion recognition task. This conveys that regardless of what diagnosis or condition a person is suffering from, the damage to the amygdala will impact one’s perception of emotion in faces.<nl><nl>The evidence that is provided above clearly goes against the BET, as ASD and encephalitis individuals were not able to correctly identify negative faces (Broks et al.,1998; Ashwin et al., 2006), meaning that it is not a biological process as Ekman had stated. But despite this, it can still be argued that if ASD individuals did have an intact amygdala, they would correctly identify emotion from faces. However, if this were the case a neurotypical individual would correctly identify all emotions in a facial emotion recognition task, but Wallace et al (2008) had found that the neurotypical individuals still managed to incorrectly recognise anger as disgust 10% of the time. This further complicates the BET, as it shows to not be as hardwired as it mentions. <nl><nl>To conclude the two opposing theories of facial recognition of emotion have two different fields of research. A large body of evidence in cultural differences has come to show that the BECV theory has been an appropriate theoretical model to explain why facial recognition is not universal, additionally, evidence in the field of neuropsychology challenges the BET  model. The converging evidence in these two fields has still come to show that the universality thesis can be refuted.", "d afternoon, could you help me with any internship opportunities for me related to any foreign office, government, local council, or anything related to the government and I had a talk with someone from the university who told me that there are some opportunities that can be done online, because I can only have opportunities located in <city>.<nl><nl>Thank you<nl><nl> <nl><nl>Regards<nl><nl><part_FN><new>Good afternoon, I'd like to register for the <event> on <day> <DDth> <month> at 1pm.<nl>My name is <part_FN_MN_SN><nl>My email address is <email_address> <nl>My University is <university> <nl>My University course is <course> <nl><nl>Thank you <nl><nl>Regards <nl><part_FN><new>Good evening, thank you for all these opportunities emailed.

{"id": "a1b5f9b0-e928-4eec-905a-50c8ab61c21a", "discourse_types": ["essay", "memo"], "pair": ["Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a concept that captures the obligation of a business to the environment, its stakeholders and the broader society (Blowfield, 2005). Over the years, the concept has evolved from corporate philanthropy (Bowen, 1953) to incorporate broader concerns such as environment and human rights, driven by social rights and legislative change (Carroll and Shabana, 2010). In recent years, CSR has been viewed as a link between business strategy and sustainable development, causing companies to utilise industry standards such as the United Nations Development Goals and Global Compact. This pressure from stakeholders to go beyond the minimal requirements allows companies to address broader goals and objectives, and by doing so, a positive brand image is created (Carroll, 2016).<nl>Political influence can be defined as a \"social influence process in which behaviour is strategically designed to maximise short-term or long-term self-interest, which is either consistent with, or at the expense of other’s interests\" (Ferris, Russ and Fandt, 1989). Political CSR is described as activities where \"CSR has an intended or unintended political impact, or where intended or unintended political impacts on CSR exist\". Therefore, political CSR can be used in three ways, which will be analysed further; these include being used as a substitute for non-conventional forms of political activity or directly supporting conventional political activities such as lobbying and constituency building. Additionally, CSR can be used in a novel or innovative way which does not directly correspond to political activity (Frynas and Stephens, 2014). This assignment will evaluate research surrounding the relationship between CSR and political activity, analysing the three ways CSR has been utilised to advance corporations political standing concerning real-life cases.<nl>The reasons in which CSR can be strategically used generally concerns initiatives to build corporate brand image or reputation, constituency building, building relationships and even agenda setting whereby donations can reinforce key industry messages to shift perceptions (Fooks and Gilmore, 2013). In order to analyse the relationship between CSR and political influence, this report will be focusing heavily on the research surrounding Coca-Cola, British American Tobacco and oil and gas companies. However, it must be noted that there is a limitation of the research surrounding the relationship between CSR and political influence, as it primarily focuses on these industries.<nl>Industries surrounding public health and the environment has been seen to invest heavily in CSR operations to \"offset\" their negative brand image and gain political support due to operations that are seen as working directly against society’s benefit (Fooks and Gilmore, 2013). For-profit corporations have been increasingly promoting that they act as partners with government and communities to address social problems. These partnerships are what Coca-Cola’s former CEO refers to as \"connected capitalism\", in which collaborations help maximise shareholder value (Foster, 2014). In turn, by utilising constituency building, corporations can facilitate access to policy elites and build relationships with them. This relates to a global triangle, an approach to sustainability in which business, government, and civil society join. Coca-Cola’s CEO claims the partnership system Coca-Cola has developed is \"the most beautiful example\" of the golden triangle where each party can come together and make a difference to big societal problems (Radtke, 2013).  Although CSR sees an increasingly political role for business firms, corporations are analysed to \"step in\" using \"a global triangle\" to fill governance gaps which they present as governments failing to do so alone. This positioning to take on political responsibilities is seen as a way to present themselves as pursuing public interests whilst pursuing their own political interests whilst building relationships (Eberlein, 2019).<nl>CSR as a means of Constituency Building and Facilitating Access to Policy Elites<nl>Ha and Hoang (2020) discovered a positive relationship between corporate social responsibility and political risk, suggesting that firms are more likely to invest in CSR as an \"insurance mechanism\" against adverse political events. Corporations can utilise CSR to support conventional political activities through constituency-building strategies to establish relationships with key opinion leaders, policymakers, media, and community involvement. In turn, this attempts to influence public policy by gaining the support of voters and citizens, who in turn express their preferences to political decision-makers (Mialon et al., 2016) (Hillman and Hitt, 1999). Although constituency building is a relatively robust strategy, Rehbein and Schuler (2013) argue that it is hard for companies to implement effectively. This is due to the difficulties convincing societal groups to politically participate, showing the support of a corporation. Even if stakeholders were to participate, it is hard to guarantee their effectiveness (Mialon et al., 2016).<nl>Neu et al. (1998) discussed that firms expanding their efforts to manage their legitimacy forestalls regulatory activities by the state that might occur without these efforts. Therefore, utilising CSR as a method of constituency building can minimise the political, legislative changes that can broadly impact businesses due to the legitimisation effect. For example, Mialon et al. discovered that Coca-Cola in Australia heavily used constituency building strategies by using CSR to have relationships with health organisations, community groups and policymakers. More specifically, Coca-Cola developed an initiative to encourage physical activity for kids called \"The Happiness Cycle\", partnering with an Australian charity. This was also interpreted as an agenda-settingframing activity as the company promoted the initiative to \"curb obesity\" and emphasised that they wished to be \"part of the solution\" (Mialon et al., 2016).<nl>By using their reputation and influence in a region gained by their CSR initiatives, companies such as Coca-Cola can wield power in governmental organisations. This was present in India, where two members of FSSAI (Food Safety Standards Authority India) are affiliated with an organisation funded by Coca-Cola. This organisation has undermined public health policies by networking with nutrition sciences to nudge \"government policy into alignment with the company’s corporate interests\" (Greenhalgh, 2019). By employing CSR through community campaigns, corporations can gain a sense of \"legitimacy\" that forms a sense of trust, increasing the likelihood that constituency building will be effective and increase their political influence. Furthermore, enhancing legitimacy enables corporations to conduct business activities more effectively than firms that do not engage in community CSR activities and may help minimise risks such as shareholder activism, boycotts of products and negative media coverage (Mirvis, Googins and Rochlin, 2007).<nl>However, Mialon et al.’s research surrounding the food industry's corporate political activity can be criticised because it could only incorporate publicly available information. This means that the research is unlikely to give a complete picture of the practices adopted by the food industry, as there is a lack of public documentation surrounding political activity, such as lobbying policymakers and private interactions. Therefore, this questions the validity of their findings, and the specific details of how CSR industry practices influence political activity needs to have further investigation.<nl>Exploiting CSR politically to work with other influential groups creates the perception that the message a corporation wishes to convey is balanced and credible, adding to the benefits of using CSR as a means of constituency building (Friedman et al., 1994). Using statistical analysis, Navarro (1998) concluded that although a company’s philanthropic activities can enhance brand image, increasing the effectiveness of lobbying activities, there was no direct relationship found between CSR activities and policy outcomes. As suggested previously, only firms working against public welfare will be using CSR to gain political influence, such as those within public health and energy industries. Therefore, as Navarro’s study incorporated a range of firms from different industries, it was unlikely to find a correlation between CSR and political outcomes. <nl>CSR can be strategically utilised to meet stakeholder needs and improve a company’s competitiveness and profitability (Porter and Kramer, 2006). CSR can be used to gain a positive brand image to attract more customers with the increasing demand from stakeholders for companies to adopt socially responsible practices to create a more sustainable and equitable world. Not all CSR initiatives are used to gain political influence, but the benefits of a positive brand image indirectly can help firms gain political power through Constituency and Relationship Building.<nl>CSR as a means of Agenda Setting<nl>As mentioned previously, CSR is also used as an Agenda Setting method to produce political effects. Fooks discovered a close connection between agenda-setting and constituency building where donations were allocated by BAT to groups \"based on their potential to shape policy agenda through their influence on government thinking and news reporting\" (Fooks and Gilmore, 2013). Smoking tobacco is the leading cause of death, illness and impoverishment, killing more than 8 million people each year (WHO, 2020). However, despite this significant public health crisis, tobacco companies and other unhealthy commodities utilise CSR as a PR initiative to create the illusion that they are a \"changed\" company and operate with health interests (WHO, 2009). Research by Fooks et al. analyses that Philip Morris and British-American Tobacco (BAT) engages in CSR primarily due to the potential to promote policy outcomes that work against public welfare. Specifically to prevent the introduction of effective government regulation, which has a record of effectiveness in reducing tobacco consumption (Fooks et al., 2012). Utilising CSR as an Agenda Setting method has allowed BAT to make donations towards reinforcing industry messages designed to alter the discussion of tobacco control away from public health and more towards the economic impacts and employment opportunities the industry gives.<nl>Agenda setting aims to manipulate public awareness surrounding issues prevalent in an industry that directly correlates to Coca-Cola. Hamilton (2015) discovered that Coca-Cola’s press releases surrounding CSR have a language that exhibits a paternalistic mentality with words like \"serve,\" \"help,\" and \"provide\". This paternalistic activism contends that outsiders are not best equipped to solve social and environmental issues, therefore boosting the image of their importance. The corporation exhibits a \"power-over\" approach that analysed as robbing communities of the \"decision-making process that affect their lives\" (Ledwith and Springett, 2010). It is hard for the general population to gain back their political influence from corporations acting in a CSR positive way when considering the substantial disparity between communities and Coca-Cola’s access to resources, political decision-makers, and media outlets (Hamilton, 2015). <nl>Additionally, in Georgia, USA, the Coca-Cola foundation pledged $3.8m to tackle obesity with the public health agency, the CDC (Radtke, 2013). The Times reported that the money given to the CDC contributed towards a strategy of funding scientists \"who encouraged the public to focus on exercise and worry less about how calories contribute to obesity\" (Kaplan, 2017). Utilising this charitable CSR initiative can take the narrative away from their unhealthy sugar-filled drinks contributing to obesity. By presenting themselves alongside their CSR projects using paternalistic vocabulary to the media, Coca Cola can shape the public agenda and shift perceptions of the underlying adverse effects of their operations and impact on public health. <nl>Gómez (2019) found that three primary factors can limit Coca-Cola’s agenda-setting influence, which is likely to impact other corporations. First, the ability of industry lobbyists to meet with legislative members; second, the pre-existing ties a government has with a corporation and the interests they have in benefiting from the companies’ operations and finally; the corporation supported researchers and activist’s vs the public health advocates, which are divided on opinions. All three of these limiting factors can have risk reduced by CSR initiatives surrounding constituency building, building relationships, agenda-setting and improving brand image.<nl>CSR as a means to support lobbying activities<nl>Regarding lobbying to change the narrative, it is a practice whereby a company or organisation aims to influence government leaders to create legislation that will benefit their industry somehow. The oil and gas industry has been reported as the 6th highest lobbying spender in the United States in 2020 (Duffin, 2021). It is common practice for oil and gas companies to engage in \"greenwashing\" to appear more environmentally responsible (Cherry and Sneirson, 2011). Nasiritousi (2017) wrote about oil and gas companies and how their input and attendance at climate change conventions is controversial as one of the most significant contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. However, they portray themselves as lobbyists against climate change and fund organisations which discredit climate science. These corporations spend countless amounts of money to change the narrative, such as campaigns that convince consumers that their lifestyles must change, as also seen with Coca Cola previously. Campaigns promote that humans are the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases- prevaricating the possibility that they are the largest polluters. Showing that they are \"reactive\" to these issues and rebranding themselves as part of the solution to the climate crisis helps to minimise the chances of a significant policy change being implemented that will further impact their business (Cherry and Sneirson, 2011).<nl>The oil and gas industry can be analysed using Goffman’s (1959) self-presentation theory whereby activities are analysed by a \"front-stage\" of how companies present themselves sustainably and the \"back-stage\" which relates to their corporate political activities. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) bill has been a considerable controversy for the oil industry. It was designed to allow oil investigations to occur in sensitive environmental areas (Cho et al., 2016). Environmentalists and Indigenous communities disputed the ANWR bill due to the irreparable impact oil companies would have on their land. Cho et al. (2016) analysed how oil firms sustainability and CSR practices pressed on the importance of environmental care, ensuring that their CSR practices were visible. However, they kept their proactive political actions targeted towards their interests of passing the bill \"back-stage\". This is a form of impression management whereby firms push CSR practices to an audience to be perceived favourably, and these elements are what the firms are getting more attention for. This method of emphasising positives and underplaying the negatives of their intentions is a common component of sustainability reports whereby corporations will seek to demonstrate how their activities are aligned with social expectations (Goffman 1959; Collinson 1999; Cho et al., 2016).<nl>Corporate Reputation and Image<nl>In addition, Chen et al. (2007) discuss how US companies with worse product and safety infringements were more likely to give to charity than those with better records. They analyse how CSR can be used as a \"distracting technique\" which is an innovative method of gaining political influence without directly operating politically. Their findings suggest that corporate philanthropy is used more for legitimisation than a measure of CSR performance. Companies can legitimise operations by utilising creative philanthropic activities by rebranding their image to reshape public imagination or ideology (Chen et al., 2007). <nl>For example, trans-national corporations (TNC) are known for exploiting the environment in emerging market economies more commonly than developed economies. This is because TNC’s are likely to utilise the cheap labour and abundance of resources available in emerging market economies and exploit these for profit-maximisation purposes (Khanna, Palepu and Sinha, 2005). In order to minimise political changes such as increased taxes, emission permits and caps on natural resource use, companies can employ CSR initiatives to regions to improve the country’s infrastructure and social programmes, presenting themselves as a positive contributor to the region (Hohnen and Potts, 2007)<nl>In 2000, Coca-Cola established a plant in Kerala, India, where their bottling plant drew around 510,000 litres of water from open wells and boreholes. Non-governmental organisations (NGO’s) discovered that water table levels have decreased from 12m to 35m below the groundwater level. Local women and children had to walk nearly 5km twice a day to fetch water, although it was often unsuitable for drinking and bathing as the water burned their eyes and led to numerous skin conditions (Raj and Shaji, 2017). Additionally, harvest dropped by 40% due to the lack of irrigation, and Coca-Cola allowed toxic wastewater to flow into farmers’ fields near the bottling plants (Foy and Senker, 2012). Coca Cola has been documented to have numerous unethical violations worldwide, such as human rights violations in Columbia and environmental violations in India. <nl>However, The Coca-Cola Foundation has donated over $1 billion in contributions to enhance local communities’ sustainability, focusing on areas such as water conservation and recycling, economic empowerment for women, providing education, youth development, and other community and civic initiatives (Coca-Cola, n.d.). These donations are vital to governments that do not have the financial means to provide these services themselves, therefore relying on TNC’s heavily, which increases the power corporations hold in these regions (Willem te Velde, 2002). By positioning themselves as intensely involved in water conservation and community products, unethical behaviour is more likely to be overlooked, and instead, stakeholders will focus on the positive efforts made (Johnston, Amaeshi, Adegbite and Osuji, 2019). So, by engaging in CSR practices, incorporating business initiatives that benefit society, Coca Cola can uphold its positive image as a family-focused brand whilst minimising chances of political penalties on operations.<nl>Although the theory of using CSR as a method of distraction which Chen et al. (2007) discusses, was a strongly developed argument that companies with worse environmental and product safety history were more likely to give to charity than those with better operational history had some limitations to consider. The research focused on the pattern of charitable donations as purely a distraction technique, ignoring the discussion on the other reasons and effects of the patterns of charitable giving such as political CSR. Despite this, the research mentioned above shows a pattern of CSR encouraging bad behaviour to more likely be overlooked and instead, stakeholders will focus on the positive efforts made (Johnston, Amaeshi, Adegbite and Osuji, 2019). So even though CSR can be used as a distracting technique per se, the charitable contributions produce a legitimisation effect, which can help with political activities such as lobbying, access to policy elites, and constituency building due to the increased positive brand image.<nl>Final Analysis to Conclude<nl>It is without a doubt that there is a strong relationship between corporate social responsibility and political influence from the research provided above. However, as expressed previously, different industries are likely to use political CSR in vastly alternative ways, leading this topic to be challenging to analyse. Most research surrounds public health and environmental corporations that produce negative externalities to society. Therefore, even though the research utilised shows the strengths in the relationship, it cannot be entirely reliable and applied to all industries.<nl>The research provided in this paper suggests that there is a relationship whereby CSR is used as an insurance mechanism against political risks, insinuating that corporations are likely to increase CSR activities when the political environment is uncertain. Without a doubt, industries working against the public’s welfare have benefitted from using CSR as a means to gain political influence, as seen with the oil and gas industries \"greenwashing\" activities, Coca-Cola’s constituency building and BAT’s donations to shape policy agenda. Additionally, improving brand image has been seen to help corporations legitimise operations to shape the views of the public and policy setters by forming a sense of trust.<nl>In order to identify the true relationship between corporate social responsibility and political influence, it would be necessary to expand research in a broader range of industries. The available research displays a pattern between increasing CSR practises when operational activities are not in the public interests. Therefore, it can be concluded that there is a strong relationship between CSR and political activities, at least in the industries concerning public health and energy, or involving questionable product safety. If this were applied to industries that do not primarily work against public welfare, there would be a weaker relationship between CSR and political influence.", "Hi Ms (name), After reviewing the local area in Helsinki, I have planned an itinerary for you to view. Firstly, Hotel Haven has a superior room between the 2nd and 4th of September, a 30-minute drive from the airport into the city centre. The hotel is the closest to the water that I could find, averaging Â£163 a night. The room also includes a \"great\" breakfast, as booking.com states; however, local cafes are available if you wish to venture out. Cafe Roasberg serves \"The Best\" Coffee and is a hotspot for breakfast options within a distance from the hotel. Roasberg is a 10 minute walk8 minute bus9minute car journey from the hotel. For local cuisine options, I discovered Kalerian Stew, a traditional meat dish that combines pork and beef, and no seafood ingredients are included. Konstan Molja is famous for its stew in Helsinki, and the restaurant is a 21 minute walk8 minute drive16-minute bus from the hotel. Regarding museums to explore the city's history, the national museum of Finland explores the regions past and cultural heritage. This is a 21 minute walk6 minute drive12-minute bus from the hotel. Souvenir shops conveniently surround the hotel, and I have chosen Kankurin Tupa, a 6-minute walk around the corner. They appear to have a large selection of items which I'm sure you'll be able to find something suitable for your children. Finally, G Livelab in Helsinki is an 8 minute walk4 minute drive from the hotel and has good wine and cocktails available. Along with this, numerous reviews state that they have a good atmosphere, and although they are primarily a live music venue, they host the occasional improv comedy night for 10 Euros. I hope this all sounds appealing to you. Xian Mullard"]}

{"id": "e3ba6746-30bb-4186-b8a5-025199202326", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Introduction<nl>Enterprise Car Club operates across the UK, offering accessible, eco-friendly vehicles at a low cost for a small monthly subscription. Car Club are owned by Enterprise who provide car rentals, sharing and sales across 8,000 locations worldwide. <nl>Enterprise Car Club are looking to expand operations and target the student demographic of Birmingham. This plan offers solutions for the next 12 months to identify, target and market to the chosen demographic, whilst evaluating the individual methods and their collective effects. This marketing plan aims to boost brand awareness and grow the business and operations within Birmingham. <nl>Evaluation of market segment<nl>With 81,000 students in Birmingham (HESA 2020), this segment is a sizeable target market for Enterprise and presents a strong opportunity for the business. Car Club currently offers a package aimed at younger drivers however, it is important to remember that a proportion of students would fall outside of this ‘Under 22’ bracket, hence the suggested target demographic is 19 – 25. Marketing should be specialised for each package where possible. For example, promotions at fresher’s fairs should focus on the ‘Under 22’ package as this is most relevant to first year students.<nl><nl><nl>Market segments should be distinct, accessible, measurable and profitable. This demographic is distinctive within Birmingham from their abundant population on campus and active social-media usage, making them easily targetable. Students with busy lifestyles are most likely to use this service, those with part-time employment andor heavy involvement in student life (clubssocieties) would have the biggest need to travel around the city.<nl>This segment is easily accessible as these students are more likely to be present on campus due to their universityclubsociety commitments and can be targeted online through student social-media communities. Usage statistics on demographics, distance and potentially even purpose can be collected through the Car Club app allowing for easy measurability. Unique promo-codes allow for measuring of marketing methods efficiency through the app which is vital to measuring success.<nl>Finally, this segment has great profitability potential. Although the student community is not the most affluent, their large population (81,000 - HESA 2020) provides scope for a substantial profit. With competitive pricing and effective marketing, Car Club could compete against companies like Uber, changing the trend in student intra-city travel.<nl><nl>Positioning<nl>As Car Club is unique, the potential competition is diverse. For intra-city travel, Uber and Ola currently control the student market, with busses being another viable, low-cost option. For car rental, Majestic and Sixt both operate within Birmingham, offering users more freedom but at a higher cost.<nl>To identify Car Club’s market position, these perceptual maps evaluate the companies based on pricing, convenience and diversity. Price is key to driving business when targeting low-income students. Convenience is important regarding city travel as this can drive consumers away if it is lacking. For convenience, factors such as ease of booking, required walking distances, arrival time, vehicle availability, parking and requirement for rebooking were all considered. <nl>Finally, diversity was deemed vital as it reflects a consumers’ initial requirement for travel. The ability to hireutilise different vehicles enables consumers to travel with varied group sizes and bring any necessary luggage. As students rarely have access to their own vehicles, utilising vehicles for transporting belongings can be just as essential as transporting people.<nl><figure><nl>If we assume regular vehicle usage, Car Club leads the market for pricing. With base prices of £3.45-5.95hour, Car Club stands ahead of the bus and app-based taxi companies which start cheaper, at around £2.50 for short distances but grow substantially for longer journeys and return fares. It’s important to note that this depends on the nature of the trip, if the bus journey is short and direct then this would become the cheapest option. However, assuming customers will be travelling varied distances, they would potentially have to catch multiple busses, hence the lower rated bus pricing. <nl>Sixt and Avis start at £51 (Sixt 2020) and £60 (Avis 2020) for a day, with Sixt having an extra charge of £36day for our younger target market. Although this is a competitive hourly rate, the inability to hire by the hour makes this unaffordable for most student needs.<nl>The taxis command the market for convenience, with Uber taking a competitive-edge due to its greater vehicle availability and thus, lesser wait time. Car Club’s easy-to-use app comes a close second but is restricted by the walking requirements to reach and drop-off the vehicle. Sixt &amp; Avis have the same issue but require collection at specific locations such as Grand Central, rather than being spread across multiple locations like Car Club. Finally, the bus is least convenient due to the walking requirements and the lack of destinationroute flexibility.<nl>In summary, Car Club is the most cost-effective solution for student city travel, with the exception of short, one-way inner-city stints. However, as Enterprise lease vehicles in 30-minute slots, these customers are not within the proposed target market. As Car Club sits within the top segment for convenience, it holds a very strong market position, particularly against its car-hire competitors. Although not as readily available as Uber and Ola, Car Club is more cost-effective as multiple journeys are possible within the hire time. Its strong market position makes it a fantastic product to market to students and if advertised correctly, it has a high probability of success.<nl><figure><nl>Diversity is a tighter category than convenience, but Car Club still holds a strong position. This is an important consideration for students as, although their age ranges are similar, they will have different work commitments and will be involved in different aspects of university life. The vehicles therefore must cater for any eventuality, be it transporting one individual, a group or equipment for a sports team!<nl>The vehicle range Car Club possesses is essentially unlimited for students as there are small cars for inner-city travel, larger vehicles to carry big groups and the ability to hire vans for equipment transport, giving an edge on taxi companies. Car Club’s lack of luxury vehicles means a lower rating than Sixt however, the financially conscious student market has little demand for this category.<nl><nl>Car Club’s market position has significant potential, with affordability being the biggest asset. Car Club is also highly convenient and has a diverse range of vehicles at its disposable, making it a strong competitor within the city. It may be difficult to change the current trend of app-based taxi usage but with effective marketing, Car Club undoubtedly has the right product to do so.<nl>From Car Club’s positioning, its unique selling points (USPs) are clearly convenience, affordability and its multi-purpose fleet. The company also boasts short hire times (from 30minutes), app-friendly hire, a sustainable vehicle range (important to our target demographic) and an existing global network giving access to vital labour and capital for this venture. Enterprise prides itself on honesty and customer service which will also be demonstrated through marketing. Keeping prices low and maintaining the current fleet will be key to ensuring business growth in Birmingham.<nl><figure><nl>Vaughn (1980) published a journal featuring his FCB gridmatrix which is a useful consideration prior to beginning marketing. As the product is practical and relatively low cost, membership could fall into quadrant-3 and be deemed habitual. However, due to the low income of our target market and the commitment required for a monthly subscription, Car Club sits between quadrant 1 &amp; 3. Marketing should henceforth be focussed on factual rather than an emotive appeal. Consumers may need some information and persuasion before buying into the club, but the practical and effective product should become habitual for the consumer and should not require further promotions once established in their lives.<nl><nl>Campaign Objectives<nl>1) Expand Car Club within Birmingham by increasing the number of users on the app. Reach 8,100 signups by year end (10% of student population)<nl>As a new business within the city, Car Club must establish itself within the market, creating a customer base from which it can grow. Reaching 10% of Birmingham’s student population is an achievable target, especially when attending all fresher’s fairs (see below). Although these signups may not all become revenue-generating regular users, they are key to ascertaining a position in the market and will increase demand for Car Club through word-of-mouth promotion. Year-end signup statistics will demonstrate Car Club’s success, hopefully providing the company with an effective platform for further growth, enabling focus on new objectives such as customer retention.<nl><nl>2) Increase brand awareness by boosting on-campus presence. Attend all university fresher’s fairs within the city<nl>Attending five fairs is a very achievable target and will be easy to measure completion. These events are fantastic for changing student trends and encouraging new behaviour as open-minded freshers form a substantial proportion of the student population. Presence at these will initially create signups, but also will build brand awareness, increasing the likelihood of new users’ involvement in future promotions. Personal sellers working at the fair can offer unique, promotional signup codes, making tracking this objective simple, demonstrating the best universities for Car Club and which ones may need further investment. <nl><nl>Strategy and Rationale for Selected Tools<nl>The proposed strategy will incorporate push and pull features to both build brand awareness and to encourage habit-forming.<nl>Push strategy – Consistent advertisement throughout year to raise brand awareness with focus early on to encourage change in student’s current travel trends. Influencing them at this early stage will encourage them maintain this habit, increasing word-of-mouth promotion through their future university years. The push strategy is also key to match competitors’ attempts to infiltrate the market, without this, Enterprise’s new venture may be lost amongst its competitors.<nl><nl>Pull strategy – This takes advantage of the persuasive power of personal selling and focus on changing student trends. When supported with regular advertisement, it will create a lasting impression in consumers’ minds, leading to more signups and maintaining brand awareness.<nl>As part of the proposed pull strategy of personal selling, unique promotions can be offered to customers. This personal aspect adds value to the exchange and is more powerful than online promotions, it should increase signups and extend our loyal customer base. These customers’ positive feelings towards the brand should lead to increased word-of-mouth promotion.<nl><nl>Marketing tools plan<nl>Personal selling<nl>Personal selling is \"the process of person-to-person communication … in which the former learns about the customer's needs and seeks to satisfy those needs by offering the customer the opportunity to buy … a good or service.\" (Cant M.C. and Van Heerde, 2004, pg.3). Personal sellers’ presence on campus at  fairs and throughout the year will keep brand-awareness high, encouraging students to think of Car Club when in need of transport. Personal sellers can also persuade consumers using sales tactics and promotions, clearly explaining Car Club’s benefits and reacting to responses in real time. This creates a substantially higher probability of consumers making a purchase due to the sense of exclusivity and the increased memorability having more influence than a regular advertisement. <nl><nl>Promotions can be in the form of unique signup codes, enabling Enterprise to track the effectiveness of both the individual personal sellers and the campaign. This would illustrate the best sellers and locations, ensuring maximum efficiency. Promotions could also be offered in-app for the second hire to encourage habit-forming. Usage statistics of this offer would give a good indication of satisfaction with the service after the first use.<nl>Although personal selling is not renowned for dramatically boosting sales, the on-campus presence of personal sellers will help to maintain brand awareness. This will give Enterprise’s Car Club an edge on existing competitor options. A consumer that becomes a regular user through personal selling will better understand the brand and company values, making them a useful asset for word-of-mouth promotion. <nl>Testing<nl>Personal sellers’ ability to receive instant feedback makes them a useful asset for prepost-testing. Fresher’s fairs provide the opportunity to conduct surveys about travel habits and opinions on advertising. This allows Enterprise to adapt marketing methods if needed, prior to investing substantial capital into the  venture. Surveys could also be mandatory on signup for the app, gathering valuable data.<nl>Post-testing is also possible on the application, short surveys about where users heard of Car Club and general usage information could be vital to making effective future investments.<nl><nl>Advertising<nl>Advertising is \"a paid, mediated form of communication … designed to persuade the receiver to take some action, now or in the future\" (Richards &amp; Curran, 2002). Advertising will raise brand awareness and increase the app signups as interest is generated, thus achieving both marcomms objectives. Social-media will be the main advertising channel as our chosen demographic actively use technology and the internet. UCAS’ lifestyle survey (UCAS Media 2019) found that  \"77% of students are using Instagram, and 75% are using Facebook\". TikTok has also become popular within the student community since that article. Ads can easily be targeted to Birmingham students to increase click-through rates and relevance of the ad to the viewer. Picture and short video ads designed to demonstrate Car Club’s convenience and affordability will be used on TikTok, Instagram and Facebook. This should cover the most students’ social-media usage whilst remaining affordable.<nl>Alerts can also feature on the app to remind inactive users of the service. Advertisement efficiency can be measured by monitoring click-through rates, allowing the adverts to be adjusted accordingly to maximise effectiveness.<nl><nl>Integration of marketing communications <nl>Enterprise’s corporate values are honesty, customer service and sustainability, this fits our environmentally conscious ‘Generation-Z’ target market. Creating value to the consumer by focussing on customer service and unique, personal promotions will increase word-of-mouth promotion. Word-of-mouth promotion fits ‘Generation-Z’ as they are socially active ‘communaholics’, finding little distinction between online communities and real-world socialising. Their large online reaches have potential to quickly spread positive messages about the brand worldwide.<nl>Marketing will all be focussed on the affordability and convenience of the service, highlighting the company’s market position and standing by Enterprise’s key corporate value of honesty by sticking to facts. Personal selling will allow Car Club employees to communicate this directly to the consumer whilst emphasising good customer service. Advertising is a strong addition to the marketing-mix as relevant social-media ads can be directed to our target audience. Posters will be setup in convenient locations across the city, linking to the convenience of the service.<nl>The use of digital mediums to track the app-based service is well-suited and ensures focus on efficient technology, leaving no potential for error from crossover between paperwork and online.<nl><nl>Implementation plan<nl>Personal selling, app alerts and social-media advertising will follow flighting implementation plans, just running in key months. January and September both require intensive marketing as this is when students will be joiningreturning to the university and forming habits. Securing students as customers at this point should create habits for them to carry through the year. Personal selling will not be required on campus April – Aug and in December because exams and university holidays reduce student numbers on campus. This will save money, allowing for more intensive advertising investments in September. However, social-media advertising and app alerts will still occur during exam season (May) as students remain in the city and will require transport to and from their exams and across the city to other locations such as food shops.<nl>Posters will feature in key locations across the city where individuals may need transport such as the student union, student accommodation, supermarkets and shopping centres. As posters are relatively inexpensive, they can run continuously, attracting custom throughout the year. For example, the summer months and December are usually quiet for the student population, but due to school holidays and locals Christmas shopping, footfall will remain consistent throughout the year. Although this isn’t our target market, continuing advertising throughout the year will help to ensure a consistent revenue stream.", "r <addr4_FN>,<nl><nl> <nl><nl>I am on my placement year of <course><nl><nl> <nl><nl><part_FN><new>Hi <addr4_FN>,<nl><nl>Can you please remove me from this mailing list, I do not study <course><new>Good Afternoon,<nl><nl>I saw today that final year modules have become available for selection and I am considering taking intermediate <language>.

So, for example, I'm currently writing about Hobbes and how he advocated for an authoritarian government, and I am then going to use Locke and other thinkers to dispute his beliefs and explain why they are outdated, and, essentially a bit useless in defining the modern state as it is today, but I'm not sure if I need to speak about each thinker's own personal view on human nature itself as well?

{"id": "b855dbb0-76c4-4293-87fa-a8a932f60118", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Alpha oscillatory activity (8-13 Hz) is the dominant EEG rhythm in the awake brain. Initially thought to reflect cortical idling (Pfurtscheller, Stancák, &amp; Neuper, 1996), the alpha inhibition hypothesis (AIH) suggests that high alpha is indicative of inhibition and disengagement of task-irrelevant brain areas (Klimesch, Sauseng, &amp; Hanslmayr, 2007). Supporting this, visual spatial attention tasks found a robust cortical response: when attention was directed to one hemifield via a directional cue, alpha decreased in the contralateral hemisphere (Sauseng, et al., 2005; Thut, Nietzel, Brandt., &amp; Pascual-Leone, 2006) and increased in the ipsilateral hemisphere (Worden, Foxe, Wang, &amp; Simpson, 2000; Kelly, Lalor, Reilly, &amp; Foxe, 2006), suggesting alpha oscillations were supressed in brain areas involved in active processing. Thus, alpha oscillations have emerged as an indicator of sensory supression and are proposed to play a pivatol, mechanistic role in attention by gating information flow to relevant sensory regions (Mazaheri, et al., 2014).<nl>The present study specifically analysed the effect of arrow cues proceeding stimulus onset on alpha oscillations. It is a partial replication of Sauseng, et al.’s (2005) cued visual attention task, in which they found that alpha range amplitudes were lower in parietal areas involved in active processing 200ms before stimulus onset. In line with this, the hypothesis for this study predicts that when recording from P3 in the left parietal lobe, there will be higher alpha range amplitudes for the cue left than the cue right condition.<nl>Method<nl>Participants<nl>Thirty-nine undergraduate students volunteered to participate in the study after providing informed consent. One participant was not included in the analysis due to incomplete data.<nl>Design<nl>A within-subjects design was used. The independent variable was cue direction (with two levels: left and right). The dependent variable was alpha range amplitudes within the left parietal lobe in microvolts (𝜇V).<nl>Materials<nl>The EEG alpha range activity was measured using BIOPAC MP36 and 3 electrodes. AC and Everi cream were used to apply electrodes. PsychoPy was used to present stimuli and send event markers to Biopac through a Stimtracker. The cues included left and right arrows (as shown in figures 1a and 1b), which informed participants which hemifield to expect the stimulus. The stimuli included small and large white bars (as shown in figures 1c and 1d). <nl><figure><nl>Procedure<nl>EEG alpha range activity was recorded from 3 electrodes located at the sites of the standard 10-20 system (Trans Cranial Technologies, 2012). The sampling rate was 1000 Hz and a notch filter at 50 Hz was applied. The active electrode was attached to P3, the reference electrode was attached to Fz and the earth was attached to the forehead near the hairline. These were measured relative to Cz. Electrode impedance was kept at &lt;10 kΩ.<nl>Participants were asked to perform a cued visual attention task. Figure 2 illustrates a typical trial sequence and time course of events. Each participant sat on a chair in front of a computer screen and completed a consent form. Then, the experimenter applied electrodes on the participant’s scalp and gave them task instructions. Participants were told that a cue would appear to indicate which side of the screen to expect a stimulus, followed by a brief pause where they would attend to a central fixation cross. Then, a small or large bar stimulus would appear, and they would respond accordingly using the keyboard. Each participant performed 12 practice trials with feedback (3 blocks of 4 trials) to familiarise themselves with the task, followed by 80 experimental trials without feedback (20 blocks of 4 trials). Trial types (cue right small bar, cue right large bar, cue left small bar, cue left large bar) were randomised within each block. Each trial began with a central fixation cross presented on the screen for 800ms. An arrow cue, which pointed either left or right, was briefly presented for 35ms. The direction of the arrow indicates which visual hemifield the target stimulus would appear. After a random inter-stimulus interval (ISI) between 200ms and 1200ms (800ms for practice trials), a target stimulus was presented for 50ms. A random ISI prevented participants from anticipating exactly when each stimulus would appear. Then, an event marker was sent at stimulus onset. Different markers were sent for the cue left and cue right conditions. Stimuli were either small or large white bars, presented on a black background. Participants responded by pressing the ‘L’ key if the bar was large and the ‘S’ key if the bar was small. Finally, the experimenter removed the electrodes and debriefed participants.<nl><figure><nl>Results<nl>Data treatment<nl>Event markers were sent from PsychoPy to Biopac to identify when stimuli were presented. The period 200ms before stimulus onset, after arrow cues had been shown, was analysed for cue left and cue right conditions. The raw alpha data was rectified to show alpha activity regardless of whether it was excitatory or inhibitory. Rectifying converted all negative values to positive, to get an average deviation from 0 in microvolts. Then, the data was averaged over 50 samples to reduce the impact of outlying values and smooth the data. The transformed data will be known as rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA).<nl>Data analysis<nl><table><nl>The normality of data was assessed. The Shapiro-Wilk test indicated that the cue left (W = .83, n = 38, p &lt; .001) and cue right (W = .85, n = 38, p &lt; .001) conditions were significant. Therefore, the data was not normally distributed, and non-parametric statistics were used.<nl>Table 1 shows that median RAAA were .02 higher in the cue left than cue right conditions. A Wilcoxon signed-rank rest indicated that this difference was statistically significant (T = 566, n = 38, p = .002).<nl>Discussion<nl>The results of the present study support the hypothesis that there is significantly higher alpha amplitudes for cue left than cue right conditions when recording from P3 in the left parietal lobe. These results are consistent with the AIH, as alpha activity was higher in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the cued direction of attention (Worden, et al., 2000; Kelly, et al., 2006) which indicates supression and disengagment of the task-irrelevant hemisphere (Klimesch, et al., 2007). Furthmore, these results are consistent with Sauseng, et al.’s (2005) experiment, because from -200ms to stimulus presentation, there was stronger alpha suppression contralateral to the cued hemifield. Hence, the findings highlight the suppressive nature of alpha oscillations and their crucial role in gating attention through the inhibition of irrelevant information (Mazaheri, et al., 2014).<nl>Although the results clearly support the hypothesis, it is appropriate to recognise potential limitations. A first limitation concerns the distractive environment the experiment was conducted in. There were multiple groups working simultaneously in a lab on campus. Typical distractions included students chattering, experimenters speaking loudly and ongoing lectures. It is possible that these distracted and averted the visual attention of participants away from the task (Hughes, 2014). Therefore, future researchers must ensure that the study is conducted in a silent, non-distractive environment. <nl>Another limitation is that the present results cannot be generalised to the wider population. Studies found that cue-induced alpha lateralization was observed in younger, but not older adults (Hong, Sun, Bengson, Mangun, &amp; Tong, 2015). This suggests that younger and older adults may engage in different neural mechanisms of attentional orienting, and that the AIH is a phenomenon that diminishes through aging. Thus, further research must be conducted using a large, diverse sample of participants.<nl>Despite these limitations, one application of the present study is that individuals can be trained to enhance the suppressive nature of alpha oscillations. Kerr, et al., (2011) found that mindfulness meditation enhanced cue-induced alpha modulation. By improving people’s ability to inhibit task-irrelevant information, they can be more effectively focus their attention. <nl>To conclude, the present research replicates Sauseng et al.’s (2005) findings and contributes to a growing body of evidence to suggest that alpha range activity is supressed in areas of visual cortex involved in active processing. Despite limitations, the data are valid as they are consistent with previous research and theory. Therefore, the study provides clear support for the AIH being a robust cortical response.", "r <addr11_FN>,<nl><nl> <nl><nl>Thank you so much for taking the time to review and make an exception for my placement, I am immensely grateful!

{"id": "52da7373-adf4-49f2-a90b-bf00e576c1da", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["\"The mercantile law… is the same all over the world. For… the same premises, the sound conclusions of reason and justice must universally be the same\". This opinion led to the signing of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) in 1980, coming into force on 1st January 1988. Operating on \"contracts of sale of goods between parties whose places of business are in different States\", and aiming to provide a set of default, harmonised rules to be applied in the absence of specified terms, the CISG has been adopted in ninety-four states as of September 2020.<nl>However, the UK is not a signatory; instead, English sale of goods law is governed by the Sale of Goods Act 1979. The dominance of English law in this field, demonstrated by the mirroring of it within the Hong Kong Sale of Goods Ordinance, means that if the UK ratified the Convention, it would undermine the position of its domestic law, potentially causing the loss of its international status. This alongside the CISG’s civil law influences, resulting in \"rules foreign to… the common law’ of the UK, and the lack of comprehensive cover offered by the Convention, with no mention of areas including the passing of property, makes it ‘less suitable to commodity sales than the English Sale of Goods Act’. As such, the UK government has historically seen no demand for ratification of the CISG. <nl>The commercial law on international sale of goods \"aims at establishing certainty and trust and the reduction of transaction costs\". In exploring and comparing the remedies available under both the CISG and SGA, this essay will examine the extent to which English domestic law remains capable of this; or whether the Convention \"would be a useful addition to (or in certain circumstances, replacement of) English sale of goods law as it currently exists\".<nl>Overall, I will argue that English common law promotes the most commercial certainty, and therefore ratification of the CISG is not required as an addition or replacement of the Sale of Goods Act 1979.<nl><nl>Remedies<nl>Typical of a common law jurisdiction, English law adopts a restrictive approach to remedies. Under which, the measurement used for determining remedies available is the importance to the parties of the contractual obligation being breached – differentiating between breach of a major term (\"condition\") and a lesser term (\"warranty\"). However, the classification of each term remains a matter for judicial interpretation based on the construction of the contract; this dual system being criticised as overly simplistic. The trivialisation was demonstrated when the Court of Appeal first made reference to a third classification – ‘innominate’ terms – whereby a breach may or may not lead to the right of repudiation, depending on the severity of the breach. <nl>Meanwhile, the CISG was designed considering the special characteristics of the international sale of goods, including the long distances involved, costs of transportation and length of the term of the contracts. To accommodate such factors, the Convention adopts a more permissive remedial approach, as common for a civil law jurisdiction. Set out in Article 45(1) and 61(1), remedies available depend on the breach severity, measured in relation to a ‘fundamental breach’, as defined to be an act that \"results in such detriment to the other party as substantially to deprive him of what he is entitled to expect under the contract\" . However, the Article \"does not provide clear guidelines for distinguishing fundamental breach from non-fundamental ones\" and case law, such as Doolim Corp v R Doll and Bundesgericht, does not clarify the differentiation either. <nl>As such, both the CISG and English law provide similar provisions for determining remedies available, each resulting in uncertainty. Initially, the warranty and conditions system under the SGA appears to promote certainty considering s12-15 SGA establish items designated to be conditions and warranties. However, the mention of \"innominate terms… 'fatally' remove[s this] element of certainty which is an essential provision in contracts and gives rise to an increasing number of arbitrations\". Similarly, Grebler details the uncertainty associated with defining ‘fundamental breach’ under the CISG in terms of the phasing of Article 25; explaining how the conditions, exceptions and affirmative statements within the same sentence antagonise its accurate interpretation. Hence demonstrating that both systems harbour their own uncertainty; failing to imply one is any more favourable than the other.<nl><nl>Damages<nl>Under the SGA 1979, damages serve as the primary remedy – drawing \"a distinction between a provision for a \"penalty\", which is not valid, and a provision for \"liquidated damages,\" which is valid\". Whilst other remedies exist under domestic law, and \"parties are generally free to choose their own remedies, English law will not enforce all the remedies, at least not to the same degree\". <nl>Alternatively, damages are also available under Article 74 of the CISG, which places no limit on the amount of compensation that parties can agree to pay upon breach of contract. To the same effect, damages under the CISG can also be claimed in conjunction with other remedies provided overcompensation does not occur. This flexible approach can also be seen in the principle of freedom of contract in Article 6, whereby parties can derogate from the Convention, including Article 74, in order to replace them with bespoke clauses, such as one on remedy and damages available. National law would then govern the validity of such clauses, which will be upheld in place of their CISG alternative, as seen in ICC International Court of Arbitration Award No 99781999. This being said, whilst this gives parties the freedom to establish their own remedies, they will not necessarily be enforced uniformly between countries as elements such as penal clauses are a matter of public policy, to be dictated by the jurisdiction in which the contract operates.<nl>This demonstrates that whilst \"[the] CISG approach has the merit of being more transparent and truer to the commercial purpose of very many contracts… the Sale of Goods Act approach… may be the easier to apply\". The Convention undeniably allows for a more flexible approach to damages, compared to the more limited scope of the Sale of Goods Act 1979. However, if this flexible approach, caveated by domestic law, cannot be applied and interpreted uniformly, it fails to provide the harmonisation of law that it aims to achieve; instead generating uncertainty that would be detrimental, and not a useful addition, to English law if incorporated.<nl><nl>Specific performance<nl>The doctrine of specific performance \"reflect[s] the principle… that the law should compel parties specifically to perform their contractual obligations\". Under English law, a remedy of specific performance is available under s52 SGA 1979 but is only available to the buyer, and is only granted in exceptionally rare circumstances where the \"courts of equity were without jurisdiction unless the remedy at law was inadequate\", as demonstrated by Lord Hoffman in Co-Operative Insurance Society Ltd v Argyll Stores. Whilst the doctrine in theory \"applies to all cases where the goods are specific or ascertained, whether the property has passed to the buyer or not\", there is no guarantee that the court will always exercise its discretion and enforce specific performance, even in instances where the buyer has struggled to obtain replacement goods such as custom machinery or a ship. As such, this discretionary approach under English law demonstrates a lack of uniformity in application that has been criticised for being detrimental to commercial certainty.<nl>Concurrently, under Articles 46 of the CISG, a \"buyer may require performance of the seller of his obligations unless the buyer has resorted to a remedy which is inconsistent with this requirement\", with a mirrored provision for the seller under Article 62. The lack of a requirement for the goods to be specific and identified under the contract, allows these articles to avoid \"some of the uncertainty associated with the scope of specific performance under the SGA\". However, \"due to the divergent common-law and civil-law perceptions…, the… CISG included article 28 as a compromise\", which \"seeks to preserve domestic law regarding the availability of specific performance\". As such, \"a court is not bound to enter a judgment for specific performance unless the court would do so under its own law\", as demonstrated in Magellan International Corporation v Salzgitter Hanbdel GmbH. This article therefore makes the remedy of specific performance discretionary rather than mandatory, and creates its own uncertainty as this caveat is \"disruptive [of] the Conventions underlying goal of uniformity\".<nl>Overall, the approach of English law means that the \"precise scope of when a court might have the power or discretion to grant specific performance is… unclear\". The adoption of the CISG \"will have the opportunity to clarify English law on this point\", and may allow for the widening of the scope of application based on its less restrictive definition. However, the inclusion of Article 28 means that the CISG cannot replace domestic law on this matter, and given the reluctance of the English courts to enforce s52(1) SGA, it is unlikely that the addition of the CISG to English law would result in any expansion of the doctrine, or additional commercial certainty. Instead, it is likely to cause further confusion due to the lack of uniformity in its own application, thus resulting in further costs when settling the inevitable increase in related disputes.<nl><nl>Granting of additional time (‘Nachfrist’)<nl>The Sale of Goods Act 1979 contains no express remedy for the granting of additional time in order to perform contractual obligations. S10 of the Act contains stipulations regarding timing of contracts, deeming remedy only to be available on these grounds if timing is of the ‘essence’.  Whilst the House of Lords confirmed that time stipulations in mercantile contracts will typically be considered to be of the essence, the shift away from considering breaches in terms of ‘conditions’ and ‘warranties’ results in further uncertainty. This being said, under English law the non-breaching party can grant additional time, as per s11(2) SGA, by waiving the original contractual term and establishing a new notice making the new time frame to be of the essence, as in Stickney v Keeble. <nl>Similarly, under the CISG, Articles 47 and 63 provide for the allowance of additional time as seen in civil jurisdictions, and referred to as Nachfrist after the similar German law remedy. Rooted in the CISG’s aims of maintaining viability of contract, rather than avoiding them, Nachfrist allows for ‘reasonable’ periods of delay in performance of contracts. However, as with English law’s approach, uncertainty stems from the ‘reasonability’ element of this requirement. Such uncertainty, leading to increasing disputes and ultimately higher costs of transaction, as in Germany Oberlandesgericht where whilst the original fixed period of two weeks agreed was deemed an ‘unreasonable’ addition, the seven weeks that followed were held to be ‘reasonable’ based on the facts.<nl>In both systems, whilst the approach differs, the granting of the additional period in both is seen to be a \"kind of estoppel\" preventing the non-defaulting party from seeking other remedies during this period, but for the avoidance of the contract if the additional period is not met. Equally, both systems \"give the defaulting party the protection of a reasonable time, at the expense of the innocent party's certainty of when a time period would be considered reasonable\". As such, there would unlikely be any benefit to incorporating the CISG into English law in this respect in terms of commercial certainty gained or expansion of the doctrine.<nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>\"In Commercial Law, the parties plan and negotiate their transactions based on their understanding of the legal rules that govern their transactions, and in the expectation that these rules will remain… stable in the future.\" As such, to consider incorporating the CISG into English domestic law, there would have to be notable benefits associated to outbalance the uncertainty and unfamiliarity of the new rules.<nl>Having first come into effect in 1983, and not having been updated more recently than 1979, the Sale of Goods Act would benefit from expansion and modernisation. Comparatively to the CISG, the remedies available are far more restrictive, as demonstrated by the more restricted scope for damages and limited willingness to apply principles including specific performance and the granting of additional time. Whilst all such remedies are accounted for under both the SGA and the CISG, the SGA’s approach has been criticised for giving insufficient gravitas to the complex and logistical nature of the international sale of goods. Comparatively, as the Convention borrows from a range of both common and civil law jurisdictions, it is considered to be more up to date with modern requirements of international trade, and representing of global best practices, for example catering for the ‘reasonable’ delays resulting from many transactions easily under Nachfrist rather than requiring the explicit waiving and recreation of terms.<nl>This being said, \"[an] extremely important goal for the CISG is to achieve… uniformity and certainty with regard to remedies available\", yet \"[no] international commercial legal regime can expect to be perfect, especially when it is developed on the basis of compromise between legal systems\". The required compromise is particularly evident in Article 28 of the CISG, explicitly giving domestic law superiority over the Convention in terms of specific performance. It is this compromise between common and civil jurisdictions that means that the CISG ‘contains hidden complexities which can easily lead to errors’, as in FilantoS.p.A. v Chilewich International Corp, that would likely result in an increased number of disputes if incorporated into English law.<nl>As such, I believe the outcome from the previous two consultations carried out by the UK Department of Trade and Industry on the possible incorporation of the CISG in 1989 and 1997  stands – ratification is not a priority. Whilst it would bring the UK in line with many of its global trading partners, ‘in all mercantile transactions the great object should be certainty… because speculators in trade then know what ground to go upon\",  and \"[no] matter what the merits or drawbacks of the CISG, it cannot instantly create the same measure of legal certainty and is therefore condemned to exclusion so long as English law, or rather courts and arbitrators applying English law, do their job well\". In kind, following PST Energy 7 Shipping v OW Bunker Malta (The ‘Res Cogitans’), ‘many similar cases worldwide await[ed the] decision with interest’, showing the global dominance of English law on the sale of goods remains intact. Thus, as it currently stands, the CISG remains an unnecessary addition to, or replacement for the law; instead, it should remain a guideline of global standards of best practice to which the UK can compare its own domestic law.", "r SirMadam,<nl><nl>On the <DDth> <month> I lost my student card and as a result of external financial circumstances I was unable to buy a new one as I had already a previous one.

{"id": "54aade0a-83c2-4769-83e3-3ed175ff3a61", "discourse_types": ["essay", "text_message"], "pair": ["Abstract<nl>Partial replication of Sauseng et al.’s (2005) cued visual attention task, where participants were cued, and then attended to a stimulus shown on either the right or left hemifield. 75% of the trials were congruent, in which participants were cued to the same side as the stimulus was presented, and 25% were incongruent. Alpha activity at the left parietal lobe (P3) was higher 200ms before stimulus onset when the stimulus was cued to the left compared to the right. This supports Klimesch’s (2007) alpha inhibition hypothesis, stating that high alpha activity indicates inhibition in task-irrelevant brain regions. This finding paves way to further research on the implications of alpha activity and its relation to anticipatory attention. <nl><nl>Introduction<nl>Alpha oscillations (8-13Hz) have an inhibitory function and are involved in attentional selection and suppression (Klimesch, 2012). The alpha inhibition hypothesis (AIH) (Klimesch et al., 2007) highlights that high alpha activity indicates inhibition of task-irrelevant brain regions. Alpha activity is modulated by attention, as when stimuli are presented on a screen, contralateral brain areas are activated and ipsilateral are inhibited (task irrelevant).<nl>Mazahari et al.’s (2014) cued flanker task involved typically developing (TD), combined subtype, and inattentive ADHD participants. Null or response preparation (RP) cues preceded each trial, with an 84% accuracy of the correct direction to attend. The AIH was demonstrated as TD adolescents showed the greatest alpha suppression following the RP cues, with inattentive ADHD subtypes showing the least, due to their difficulty responding to environmental cues. Greatest alpha suppression was detected directly after cue onset for the TD group, with no group difference in alpha suppression following a null cue, suggesting that RP cues influence the lateralisation of processing.<nl>Sauseng et al.’s (2005) cued visual attention task involved a central arrow indicating which hemifield, a 50% chance of being cued left or right, the participants should attend to. The target stimulus was then presented, and participants were asked whether the bar was small or large (50% chance of each). Congruent trials included an instructional cue which was consistent with the location of the bar (75% of trials), and 25% of trials incongruent.<nl>Congruent trials showed stronger alpha suppression on sides contralateral to the hemifield where the stimuli were processed, derived from EEG recordings of the parietal, frontal, and fronto-medial regions, further supporting the AIH. Incongruent trials had an opposite effect due to incorrect anticipation of the stimulus. Fronto-medial and parietal regions demonstrated phase coupling between the RP cue and stimulus onset, and post-stimulus (200-600ms). <nl>Previous research shows alpha activity increases on the contralateral side to the stimuli attended, being most prominent in parietal and occipital regions before stimulus onset. The current study partially replicates Sauseng et al.’s (2005) cued visual attention task, hypothesising an increased alpha activity in the left parietal lobe (P3) when stimuli are presented on the left hemifield compared to the right, before target stimuli are presented for congruent trials.  <nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants<nl>39 psychology undergraduate students were selected via opportunity sampling, but one participant’s data was excluded as data was only available for one condition of the experiment.<nl><nl>Design<nl>A repeated measures design consisted of the independent variable (cue location) with two levels: left or right hemifield, and the dependent variable (the alpha amplitudes of the P3 electrode in 𝜇V (microvolts)). <nl><nl>Materials<tab><nl>The active EEG electrode was used to record alpha activity, the reference electrode provided a comparison and the earth electrode reduced interference, all connected to Biopac MP36 for data collection. Everi cream removed dead skin from the scalp, and AC cream adhered the electrode to the scalp, improving conductivity. Psychopy presented stimuli and sent event markers to Biopac through a Stimtracker device. The stimuli were two arrow cues (&lt; and &gt;), and two bars (Figure 1).<nl><figure><nl><nl>Procedure<nl>Alpha band oscillations (8–13Hz) were identified in the raw EEG data recorded (0.5-35Hz) with a sampling rate of 1000Hz. The 1020 system (Trans-Cranial Technologies, 2012) was employed, wherein the active electrode was attached to P3, reference to Fz, and earth to the forehead near the hairline. An impedance reading &lt;10kΩ was required prior to data collection, after which eligible participants were provided the right to withdraw and informed consent retrieved.<nl>Participants engaged in a practice trial, which began with instructions stating a cue would appear on the screen informing them which side to anticipate a stimulus, followed by a brief pause and either a small or large bar appearing on the appropriate side of the screen. Participants were then instructed to press ‘L’ if a large or ‘S’ if a small bar appeared on the screen. The cue (&lt; or &gt;) was displayed for 35ms, followed by a fixation cross to recapture participants’ attention to the centre of the screen, and then a small or large bar appearing on the specific hemifield for 50ms. Feedback was provided after each trial, with an interstimulus interval (ISI) of 800ms and 12 trials in total in the practice run. The practice run involved 4 trial types (arrow right to either small or large bar, and arrow left to either small or large bar) each repeating 3 times. The practice run involved only congruent trials; arrows pointed to the hemifield where the stimulus was presented.<nl>After completing the practice trials, participants were introduced to the experimental trials and recording of EEG alpha activity commenced. Experimental trials differed as no feedback was provided after trials, the ISI was between 200-1200ms, 25% of the trials were incongruent (stimulus was presented in the opposite side that the cue pointed to) and 75% congruent. Event markers were sent at stimulus onset, and each trial type was repeated 20 times in a randomised order (80 trials in total), wherein 50% of trials cued left and 50% right.<nl>Upon completion, the electrodes were removed, gel cleaned from the scalp and participants were debriefed.<nl><nl>Results<nl>Data Treatment<nl>Event markers were used to identify stimulus onset. Alpha activity was investigated after display of arrow cues and 200ms before stimulus onset.  The data was rectified to convert negative values into positive, showing the average signal strength (𝜇V) compared to the range, regardless of activity being inhibitory or excitatory. Data was averaged over 50 samples to reduce the effects of outliers. Rectification and integration ensured that accurate means were taken for each condition. These rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA) were used for further analysis. <nl>A Wilcoxon signed rank test was applied as the normality of data assumption for Shapiro-Wilk’s test was violated (p &lt; .05).<nl>Table 1. <nl>Median and interquartile ranges for alpha amplitudes in left parietal lobe in cued left and cued right conditions (n=38).<nl><nl><table><nl><nl>Table 1. shows median RAAA in P3 was greater in the cue left compared to cue right condition 200ms before stimulus onset, and a Wilcoxon signed rank test shows this difference was significant (W=566, n=38, p =.005).<nl><nl>Discussion<nl>200ms prior to stimulus onset, RAAA increased at P3 when participants were cued to the left compared to the right hemifield, supporting the research hypothesis. Stimuli presented on the left hemifield led to an increase in alpha activity on the left hemisphere due to inhibition as this region is task-irrelevant, and stimuli processed on the contralateral hemisphere led to increased alpha activity at P3. The findings support both the AIH and Sauseng et al.’s (2005) findings, showing an increase in alpha activity in task-irrelevant regions prior to stimulus presentation. This is because RP cueing affects the lateralisation of processing, leading to the anticipation of stimuli appearing on the same hemifield the cue directed them to.<nl>A methodological flaw is that high impedance affects data quality as it leads to variance in the measurements and requires more trials to ensure statistical significance in analyses of P3 (Kappenman and Luck, 2010). This can be mitigated by high pass filtering and artifact rejection, along with using a cool dry recording environment.<nl>The findings of this study lend weight to Klimesch’s (2007) AIH, and the influence of attention on alpha brain activity. Future research should explore specific types of attention e.g., anticipatory and temporal, and their influence on alpha activity.", " mum do know anything about <medication> ?

{"id": "78f58277-180a-4748-846b-444728b72d00", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Rationale:<nl>The research topic I am looking at links to the use of social media and what the possible consequences are, I chose to study this topic due to the wide use of social media and how much it has taken over what we do and how we live our lives. Social media is used in many ways such as for business purposes, marketing, cultural exchanges, news sources, etc. Most people in today’s society have access to at least a minimum of one social media platform due to the increased popularity in social networking, especially in the younger generation, but my research aims to look at how this may affect an individual. According to a survey conducted in 2018 by common sense media, 40% of teenagers aged between 13-17 claimed that keeping in contact with friends on social media daily is either \"extremely\" or \"very\" important. The main research question I am looking at is what is the impact of social media on an individual’s self-perception and relationship? This will be done by conducting a semi-structured interview, with the interview schedule being in the appendices, showing the development built from the main question. This includes the effects of social media for friendships relationships and families, how mental health can be damaged and looking at whether social media is seen as healthy or not. The method of analysis I have chosen for this research topic is discourse analysis, this is the most appropriate method, for the study I am conducting, as I am investigating the perception of social media and getting a better understanding at the individual’s views of social media rather than their life experiences. The name of the participant I interviewed will not be used to protect confidentiality, so I used the pseudonym Eliza. <nl><nl>Results:<nl><nl>Discourse 1- negativity of social media<nl>Eliza understands how much social media is used and how it does cause problems despite her lack of use of social media \"I rarely use social media\". Eliza portrays the discursive object as social media and the discourse of social media being negative. Eliza knows that social media is constantly being used and that people on social media may behave inappropriately leading to serious consequences. She understands the effects it can have on a person and the reason why people may behave this way. <nl><nl><data_extract><nl> <nl>Eliza realises that on social media people can act in a way that is not the same as how they behave in real life, but their actions can ultimately hurt the people they love. She explores that people use social media in the wrong way knowing that what they are doing is wrong however some people also get treated bad on social media for no reason and this can affect an individual due to increase of negativity. <nl><nl><data_extract><nl><nl>Eliza points out that not only does negativity affect communication between people but also interferes with how an individual feels about themselves, particularly through cyber-bullying which can destroy how someone might feel about themselves and make them feel low, therefore affecting how they behave. <nl><nl>Discourse 2- vital for families<nl>Eliza does share the good things of social media being that it helps keep people in connection with each other, mainly with families. Despite the risk of suffering bullying or negativity, some people may just use social media just as a form of contact to those they cannot get a reach of often or see in person.<nl><nl><data_extract><nl><nl>Eliza explains how social media is very beneficial to socialise for the right reasons to the right people, this is a common reason for Eliza using social media herself, to be able to interact with family and keep a strong bond from members of her family she might not see very often. This shows that although social media might not be a safe place, it does have positives for bringing people together and can in some ways create a stronger community amongst people. <nl><nl><data_extract><nl><nl>Eliza then goes on to discuss how social media can be a disadvantage with family members who might not allow freedom whilst on social media and watch over what they are doing, causing dispute between people. This is obviously seen as a disadvantage as people in the younger generation especially do not want to be supervised on what they do and who they talk to by relatives however, in other ways this can be seen as a good thing as by having family members on social media, this should stop people from posting something that may be inappropriate or offensive as parents can watch what their children are doing online. Eliza then goes on to talk about reputation and states \"oh, wait and also you might post things that goes against families\", this can vary between posting something that can go against religion, can be a hateful comment such as homophobia or a revealing picture that parents would not want other people seeing. This would therefore cause strains and arguments between family members as parents may try and be controlling but children may want some space for themselves. <nl><nl>Discourse 3- loneliness <nl>Eliza shared her thoughts on whether people who use social media tend to be lonely or not. She explained that is it common for people to use social media for company and may even talk to someone that they have not met before in real life. <nl><nl><data_extract><nl><nl>She claims that people do talk to people on social media due to lack in confidence in making friends which is becoming a problem for children as they might start to rely on talking to people online and causing them to lack the right skills to communicate with people in real life. She also mentions that people do it to make themselves feel better and more appreciated by having someone talk to them in a friendly manner. This goes against the points of being cyber-bullied showing that some people who might get bullied in real life rely on people on the internet to keep then happy. Eliza did suggest that not everyone uses social media due to feeling lonely but might use it because they could potentially be bored or still require more attention and people to talk to. Some people do have enough friends and families in their lives to talk to often but might get bored and want to use social media rather than actually feeling lonely.<nl><nl>Discourse 4- social media not healthy<nl>Eliza justified that social media can be healthy in some ways but may also be unhealthy and gave her views for both sides leading a balanced answer. She claimed that a lot of people use social media just for attention and to get people to start to notice them more which also makes them feel better and improve their self-esteem but in the wrong ways<nl><nl><data_extract><nl><nl>Eliza goes on to contradict herself by then saying it is healthy as individuals could use social media to seek help and people will reply to them in a way that makes them feel better. Some people find it easier to talk on social media and if that is their way of making themselves happier than it is being used in a healthy manner. Eliza basically claims that it is the mindset we have for using social media, some people use it to be needy and have people feel sorry for them and that is not a healthy way of using social media however Eliza thinks that letting out your problems is healthy when people do it to genuinely speak their mind and helps them to feel relieved.<nl><nl>Discussion:<nl>Eliza showed moments throughout the interview where she is against the use of social media and does not agree with how it is being used these days however, she also realises the importance of it. Through experience she realised that talking to family through social media is a great phenomenon which makes her feel content, she also brought on the fact that people who may need more support use social media widely to gain that support so can make people feel better. A study done in 2003 by Janet Morahan-Martin shows that individuals that are lonelier tend to use social media more for companionship and intimacy especially compared to those who are not so much lonely.<nl>Eliza shows the different people on social media who can either improve the well-being of an individual or make it worse depending on the type of person who uses social media. Some people care about individuals and do feel sincere about those who are troubled, and then some people feel joy about intimidating others through social media and have no guilt to tear apart friendships or relationships making social media an unsafe place. With the final discourse about whether social media is healthy or not, Eliza managed to show both points of views on whether it is accepted and beneficial or whether there are consequences, she stated it should only be used for the purposes of seeking help from anyone online and to relieve whatever pain, sadness or emotion they are feeling. The wrong way to do it is by lying or exaggerating on social media just to acquire a specific response or reaction from the people reading it.", "<nl><nl> <nl><nl>I think I’ve accepted both, should I remove the rsvp for one?<nl><nl> <nl><nl>Thanks,<nl><nl> <nl><nl><part_FN>.<new>Good morning,<nl><nl> <nl><nl>Today is fine thank you!<nl><nl> <nl><nl>Is it possible to do 2:30?<nl><nl> <nl><nl>Thanks again,<nl><nl> <nl><nl><part_FN_SN><nl><nl><course>, Final Year<nl><nl><university><new>Hi <addr3_FN>,<nl><nl>I've attached all the documents I think need to be sent as drafts, I put the questions inside the research protocol rather than sending two different documents and again, highlighted questionable things in red for all documents (aside for the risk assessment which is orange). <nl><nl>I also changed my mind decided to add in the Risk Assessment so that if you do still send a template, I'll be able to update it with feedback from you and hopefully only change it once.

{"id": "3a1c7fcb-4768-4a58-8b34-db987d4fe1ad", "discourse_types": ["essay", "text_message"], "pair": ["Rational choice theory ‘deals with the way in which scarcity impinges upon the individual consumer and hence deals with the way in which such an individual makes choices’ (Estrin et al., 2012). The model is ‘predicated on the notion that individual actors purse goals efficiently’ (Outhwaite et al., 2007). The term Homo Economicus is used to describe consumers and their sole aim of ‘utility maximisation’ (Fine., 2016). In-kind and unconditional cash transfers can be used by governments to aim to raise utility and welfare of specific groups in an economy. The effectiveness of these methods may depend upon many factors such as the target group of consumers, the area of consumption they aim to impact and the monetary value of the intervention.<nl><nl>An in-kind transfer is a ‘transfer payment’ that is ‘made in a specific good or service rather than cash’ (Cengage.com., 2013). There are 3 main types of in-kind transfers; the provision of vouchers such as food stamps, the use of subsidies and providing free access to a good or service, for example, the NHS in the UK. In-kind transfers allocate the benefit provided to specific goods or services, for example, the UK Healthy start scheme provides a targeted group with ‘vouchers that can only be spent on specific healthy foods’ (Griffith et al., 2018). It was found the impact these vouchers had upon raising utility depended on how highly the consumer values healthy foods. Diagram 1 shows the impact a healthy food voucher has upon infra-marginal consumers.<nl><figure><nl>Infra-marginal consumers already spend more than the vouchers worth on healthy foods as they value these goods highly and therefore a steep indifference curve is used. They are willing to sacrifice a high proportion of other goods to gain a small extra amount of healthy foods. In the diagram, the food voucher is represented by the line A-C. The voucher has caused an increase in utility for the consumer as represented by the rightward shift in the indifference curve from U1 to U2. The original point of maximum utility is represented by point X and the new higher maximum utility point is represented by point Y. The provision of food vouchers to infra-marginal consumers has positively impacted utility. Whilst utility has increased, the impact the voucher has had upon these consumers is very ‘similar to an income-equivalent cash benefit’ (Griffith et al., 2018). This means that providing an unconditional cash transfer to these consumers instead of the vouchers would have a similar effect on utility. They are still likely to spend the additional cash on healthy foods.<nl><nl>On the other hand, distorted consumers do not value healthy foods as highly and therefore the voucher has a different effect upon their utility. Diagram 2 displays the effect of the food voucher upon distorted consumers.<nl><figure><nl>The lower utility received from consuming healthy foods is represented by a flatter indifference curve and this displays the lower marginal rate of substitution. This means that in comparison to diagram 1 the initial maximum utility point X occurs at a much lower quantity of healthy foods. The voucher causes a shift in the indifference curve from U1 to U2 and therefore increases the utility from point X to point C. This shows that the vouchers are effective in raising utility for this group of consumers. However, the line C-E represents the cash alternative of the voucher. Here we can see that if these consumers were provided with cash instead of vouchers the higher maximum utility point of Y can be reached. This shows that these consumers are unlikely to purchase healthy foods if provided with a cash alternative to the vouchers. They would instead choose to purchase a variety of other goods and services. For distorted consumers, the food vouchers are less effective in raising utility and the consumers would prefer to receive a cash payment.<nl><nl>Unconditional cash transfer programmes ‘aim to improve well-being by providing cash to targeted poor households without placing any conditions on the household’s actions’ (Institute for Financial Studies., 2018). Consumers are therefore not restricted on how they spend this money. Providing consumers with additional cash to spend effectively increases their income. The rational choice model assumes that consumers will act rationally and use any additional income to maximise utility. However, behavioural economics challenges this and suggests that the use of labels for these cash payments can influence how the consumer spends this additional money. Behavioural economics ‘adds elements of psychology to traditional models in an attempt to gain a better understanding of decision making’ (Sloman et al., 2018). For example, the UK Winter Fuel payment is a ‘cash transfer to older households’ (Beatty et al., 2014). ‘Robust evidence of a behavioural effect of labelling’ (Beatty et al., 2014) was found in relation to this unconditional cash transfer. The study found that ‘on average households spend 47% of the WFP on fuel’ (Beatty et al., 2014). This is in comparison to an expected 3% being spent on fuel if the payment was simply treated as cash. Behavioural economic tools such as nudges can be used to alter how consumers spend their income. This is a clear example of nudge theory and shows that ‘positive reinforcement’ ‘can persuade people to make a particular choice’ (Sloman et al., 2018). ‘When a label is attached to a part of their budget, subjects change consumption according to the label’ (Abler et al., 2017). This evidence shows that consumers are responsive to behavioural economic policies and therefore do not always act like Homo Economicus as suggested by the rational choice model.<nl><nl>Overall, rational choice theory suggests that unconditional cash transfers are more effective at raising consumers’ utility. It allows consumers to purchase the goods and services they decide will maximise their own utility. However, in the long run, depending upon the area of consumption being targeted in-kind transfers may be more beneficial for raising overall welfare. For example, the healthy food vouchers provide families with food of a higher quality and that is more beneficial to their health. If they were instead provided with cash, as the distorted consumer example shows, there is a chance that this money would not be spend on healthy foods and instead it may be used to purchase fast food alternatives. This is then likely to have a long-term impact on health and could contribute to strains on the healthcare system in the future. If unconditional cash transfers are to be used, behavioural economic approaches can be adopted to influence how consumers spend this money to enable the intervention to have the most desired impact.", "o I know the weathers a bit shit but mums fine with us being inside later so we’ll make it work whatever the weather does 💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕<new>We can tell your mum that we had the big umbrella up outside of it’s raining again <new>Jesus 5 hours sleep 😭😭<new>We’ve just got to go to the coop so will be back for 7 💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕<new>You can do if they’re easy to bring!

{"id": "6eb48b06-9ae8-419e-8b32-61dfc3c95227", "discourse_types": ["essay", "text_message"], "pair": ["Abstract<nl>Partial replication of Sauseng et al.’s (2005) cued visual attention task, where participants were cued, and then attended to a stimulus shown on either the right or left hemifield. 75% of the trials were congruent, in which participants were cued to the same side as the stimulus was presented, and 25% were incongruent. Alpha activity at the left parietal lobe (P3) was higher 200ms before stimulus onset when the stimulus was cued to the left compared to the right. This supports Klimesch’s (2007) alpha inhibition hypothesis, stating that high alpha activity indicates inhibition in task-irrelevant brain regions. This finding paves way to further research on the implications of alpha activity and its relation to anticipatory attention. <nl><nl>Introduction<nl>Alpha oscillations (8-13Hz) have an inhibitory function and are involved in attentional selection and suppression (Klimesch, 2012). The alpha inhibition hypothesis (AIH) (Klimesch et al., 2007) highlights that high alpha activity indicates inhibition of task-irrelevant brain regions. Alpha activity is modulated by attention, as when stimuli are presented on a screen, contralateral brain areas are activated and ipsilateral are inhibited (task irrelevant).<nl>Mazahari et al.’s (2014) cued flanker task involved typically developing (TD), combined subtype, and inattentive ADHD participants. Null or response preparation (RP) cues preceded each trial, with an 84% accuracy of the correct direction to attend. The AIH was demonstrated as TD adolescents showed the greatest alpha suppression following the RP cues, with inattentive ADHD subtypes showing the least, due to their difficulty responding to environmental cues. Greatest alpha suppression was detected directly after cue onset for the TD group, with no group difference in alpha suppression following a null cue, suggesting that RP cues influence the lateralisation of processing.<nl>Sauseng et al.’s (2005) cued visual attention task involved a central arrow indicating which hemifield, a 50% chance of being cued left or right, the participants should attend to. The target stimulus was then presented, and participants were asked whether the bar was small or large (50% chance of each). Congruent trials included an instructional cue which was consistent with the location of the bar (75% of trials), and 25% of trials incongruent.<nl>Congruent trials showed stronger alpha suppression on sides contralateral to the hemifield where the stimuli were processed, derived from EEG recordings of the parietal, frontal, and fronto-medial regions, further supporting the AIH. Incongruent trials had an opposite effect due to incorrect anticipation of the stimulus. Fronto-medial and parietal regions demonstrated phase coupling between the RP cue and stimulus onset, and post-stimulus (200-600ms). <nl>Previous research shows alpha activity increases on the contralateral side to the stimuli attended, being most prominent in parietal and occipital regions before stimulus onset. The current study partially replicates Sauseng et al.’s (2005) cued visual attention task, hypothesising an increased alpha activity in the left parietal lobe (P3) when stimuli are presented on the left hemifield compared to the right, before target stimuli are presented for congruent trials.  <nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants<nl>39 psychology undergraduate students were selected via opportunity sampling, but one participant’s data was excluded as data was only available for one condition of the experiment.<nl><nl>Design<nl>A repeated measures design consisted of the independent variable (cue location) with two levels: left or right hemifield, and the dependent variable (the alpha amplitudes of the P3 electrode in 𝜇V (microvolts)). <nl><nl>Materials<tab><nl>The active EEG electrode was used to record alpha activity, the reference electrode provided a comparison and the earth electrode reduced interference, all connected to Biopac MP36 for data collection. Everi cream removed dead skin from the scalp, and AC cream adhered the electrode to the scalp, improving conductivity. Psychopy presented stimuli and sent event markers to Biopac through a Stimtracker device. The stimuli were two arrow cues (&lt; and &gt;), and two bars (Figure 1).<nl><figure><nl><nl>Procedure<nl>Alpha band oscillations (8–13Hz) were identified in the raw EEG data recorded (0.5-35Hz) with a sampling rate of 1000Hz. The 1020 system (Trans-Cranial Technologies, 2012) was employed, wherein the active electrode was attached to P3, reference to Fz, and earth to the forehead near the hairline. An impedance reading &lt;10kΩ was required prior to data collection, after which eligible participants were provided the right to withdraw and informed consent retrieved.<nl>Participants engaged in a practice trial, which began with instructions stating a cue would appear on the screen informing them which side to anticipate a stimulus, followed by a brief pause and either a small or large bar appearing on the appropriate side of the screen. Participants were then instructed to press ‘L’ if a large or ‘S’ if a small bar appeared on the screen. The cue (&lt; or &gt;) was displayed for 35ms, followed by a fixation cross to recapture participants’ attention to the centre of the screen, and then a small or large bar appearing on the specific hemifield for 50ms. Feedback was provided after each trial, with an interstimulus interval (ISI) of 800ms and 12 trials in total in the practice run. The practice run involved 4 trial types (arrow right to either small or large bar, and arrow left to either small or large bar) each repeating 3 times. The practice run involved only congruent trials; arrows pointed to the hemifield where the stimulus was presented.<nl>After completing the practice trials, participants were introduced to the experimental trials and recording of EEG alpha activity commenced. Experimental trials differed as no feedback was provided after trials, the ISI was between 200-1200ms, 25% of the trials were incongruent (stimulus was presented in the opposite side that the cue pointed to) and 75% congruent. Event markers were sent at stimulus onset, and each trial type was repeated 20 times in a randomised order (80 trials in total), wherein 50% of trials cued left and 50% right.<nl>Upon completion, the electrodes were removed, gel cleaned from the scalp and participants were debriefed.<nl><nl>Results<nl>Data Treatment<nl>Event markers were used to identify stimulus onset. Alpha activity was investigated after display of arrow cues and 200ms before stimulus onset.  The data was rectified to convert negative values into positive, showing the average signal strength (𝜇V) compared to the range, regardless of activity being inhibitory or excitatory. Data was averaged over 50 samples to reduce the effects of outliers. Rectification and integration ensured that accurate means were taken for each condition. These rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA) were used for further analysis. <nl>A Wilcoxon signed rank test was applied as the normality of data assumption for Shapiro-Wilk’s test was violated (p &lt; .05).<nl>Table 1. <nl>Median and interquartile ranges for alpha amplitudes in left parietal lobe in cued left and cued right conditions (n=38).<nl><nl><table><nl><nl>Table 1. shows median RAAA in P3 was greater in the cue left compared to cue right condition 200ms before stimulus onset, and a Wilcoxon signed rank test shows this difference was significant (W=566, n=38, p =.005).<nl><nl>Discussion<nl>200ms prior to stimulus onset, RAAA increased at P3 when participants were cued to the left compared to the right hemifield, supporting the research hypothesis. Stimuli presented on the left hemifield led to an increase in alpha activity on the left hemisphere due to inhibition as this region is task-irrelevant, and stimuli processed on the contralateral hemisphere led to increased alpha activity at P3. The findings support both the AIH and Sauseng et al.’s (2005) findings, showing an increase in alpha activity in task-irrelevant regions prior to stimulus presentation. This is because RP cueing affects the lateralisation of processing, leading to the anticipation of stimuli appearing on the same hemifield the cue directed them to.<nl>A methodological flaw is that high impedance affects data quality as it leads to variance in the measurements and requires more trials to ensure statistical significance in analyses of P3 (Kappenman and Luck, 2010). This can be mitigated by high pass filtering and artifact rejection, along with using a cool dry recording environment.<nl>The findings of this study lend weight to Klimesch’s (2007) AIH, and the influence of attention on alpha brain activity. Future research should explore specific types of attention e.g., anticipatory and temporal, and their influence on alpha activity.", "nting down?? x<new>Is it good?<new>I need to watch episode 3 first xx<new>😂😂 I'm assuming it's really good xx<new>You on the train now?<new>Is it direct <station1> to <station2>?

{"id": "f08ce97c-bcf6-41e0-ad0b-23e6417b0d98", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Thank you for visiting. <nl><nl>Will you be able to bring a wrongful dismissal claim against Wildlife Wonders?<nl>To legally bring a Wrongful Dismissal Claim (WDC), the employer must have unjustifiably breached fundamental contractual clauses, resulting in the employee’s consequential loss. Applying this, did Wildlife Wonders (WW) breach a term in your contract, causing you consequential loss? You are likely to be successful arguing WW breached your implied term of mutual trust and confidence, as Narinder disrespected you in front of your colleagues and did not keep your performance issues confidential. Managers are obliged to ensure workplaces offer senses of belongingness and motivation, but this was not your experience. <nl><nl>You can argue breach of Job clause, because Narinder asked you to perform duties outside your contract which were unreasonable, given you are a cameraman and not a speaker. Narinder transferred you to Accounting, which is not the job responsibilities expected from a cameraman. This may give rise to a breach in your renumeration clause, because your accounting transfer, may have increased your salary and should be paid accordingly. Your resulting consequential loss resulting is your resignation and lack of work.<nl><nl>Eligibility to bring WDC, requires the claimant to be an employee. Applying the legal test of an employee, did you wear uniform whilst working? Were you integrated and controlled by WW employees? As your manager, Narinder assigned you projects. You used a company car. This validates you were sufficiently integrated and controlled within WW, deeming you an employee. <nl><nl>The law requires the claimant must be dismissed by their employer, under misconduct. WW did not dismiss you, but you resigned. The law recognises resignations as constructive dismissal, providing it has been done at a reasonable time, justified through contractual breaches and is evidenced in writing. You telephoned Narinder your resignation notice, giving reasons. This does not take imminent, legal effect because you must provide your resignation in writing. I advise you email Narinder your resignation notice, for this will reach Narinder faster. Following this, you will be eligible to bring WDC against WW. <nl><nl>Can you bring an Unfair Dismissal Claim against Wildlife Wonders?<nl>To bring an Unfair Dismissal Claim (UDC), the law requires the employer to defend the claimant’s claim. You are likely to succeed with UDC against WW, so I shall focus on this. <nl><nl>To be lawfully eligible, the claimant must be an employee. Following my explanation in WDC section, you satisfy this. Law places two additional requirements. Firstly, the claimant must not be excluded from claiming due to their occupation. A cameraman is very unlikely to be excluded and you have not signed a compromising agreement with WW. Secondly, the claimant must have worked for their employee for a continuous period of two years. you have worked for WW for ten years, allowing you eligibility to bring UDC.  <nl><nl>Procedural requirements<nl>Regarding time limits, the law established a 3 months minus one day from effective date of termination, deadline for WDC submitted to tribunals. WDC submitted to court have 6 year deadline.  If you resigned on 28th November 2020, you have until 27th February 2021 to submit your WDC to a tribunal. You will have until 27th November 2026 to submit your WDC to court. As you want to bring a WDC and UDC, you are advised to bring both claims to a tribunal. As your salary is £52,000, any award exceeding £25,000 will be taxed and presented in court. Bringing both claims, means your legal fees is likely to be subtracted from your compensation, allowing you to bring your claims to a tribunal.  <nl><nl>I advise you submit your WDC to the tribunal as soon as possible, I am happy to assist you with this. The tribunal requires you to attend Early Conciliation meeting to settle your dispute. ACAS is an independent statutory body, aiming to provide early conciliations. You will receive a certificate number which must be presented to the tribunal as evidence of attempted conciliation. If the dispute is not resolved with WW, the tribunal will give you an additional month to submit your WDC to them. You will have until 27 March 2021 to submit WDC. You still remain an employee of WW, as you have not evidenced your resignation in writing and have not been dismissed.<nl><nl>Like WDC, the law requires the claimant to have been dismissed by their employer. You must prove you have been dismissed from WW, namely confirming your resignation in writing. Like WDC, in UDC you must attend ACAS hearing, in an attempt to settle your dispute.  <nl><nl>If you choose to formally resign and have attended ACAS hearing, you must attach the certificate number onto the ET1 Tribunal Claim Form. I am happy to assist in completing this. This will be sent to WW, who will have 28 days to respond to your claim through the ET3 Tribunal Claim Form. <nl><nl>What would be the prospects of you succeeding with each claim?<nl>You have the burden to prove your WDC and UDC. As I stated, you are likely to successfully justify both claims. Once WW have received your ET1 Form, the burden will be on them to defend your claim. They must justify their actions as being reasonable, supporting your employment contract. Narinder will attempt to argue she was reasonable in sending you to different countries for projects,  as your job is to film nature. However, Narinder was unreasonable in being disrespectful to you. Given Narinder’s lack of knowledge and your strong reputation, Narinder should have understood you. <nl><nl>Narinder has not justified her reasons for transferring you to accounting, knowing it is outside your contract and you dislike it. This represents an unjustifiable breach in your job clause, as you were not contracted to deliver talks and work in accountancy but contracted to film creatures. Narinder is unlikely to successfully justify her disrespectful comments to you. Also, you did not consent to your performance issues (should remain confidential) being publicised. <nl><nl>WDC Prospect<nl>It is unlikely WW will succeed in defending your claim, unless it amounts to gross misconduct, or WW reverse their decision of you working in Accounting department and allow you to resume working as a cameraman. <nl><nl>A tribunal will lawfully consider gross misconduct, as evidence of the employee breaching their contract, so bad that it damages the relationship between the employer and employee. This would allow the employer to dismiss the employee, without worrying about potential WDC against them, as the employee’s breach has invalidated their contract and rights to notice. Here, WW best way of proving gross misconduct is through your poor performance in the last two-three years. The tribunal however, are more likely to consider this to be minor misconduct or serious misconduct. They will consider that your poor performance was due to WW breaching your job clause by assigning you duties which were outside of your contract and profession. The tribunal will also consider your strong reputation. <nl><nl>WW may be able to defend your WDC by reversing their decision of you working in accounting and allow you to resume working as a cameraman. You will only be successful in arguing breaches in your contract, if WW did not allow you to work your notice period or they paid you less than the value of your entitled benefits, namely your pension, paid leave, discretionary Christmas bonus and use of Land Rover.<nl><nl>In law, your minimum notice period is implied into your employment contract. The higher notice period indicated in your contract or legislation will prevail. Your contract entitles you to eight weeks’ notice, but law states you are entitled to ten weeks’ notice; as you have worked with WW for ten years. Therefore WW must pay you ten weeks’ worth salary notice, plus monetary value of benefits you would have been entitled to during your notice period. <nl><nl>However, if you choose to evidence your resignation in writing, your resignation will be legal meaning your right to work your notice period will be lost. However WW are legally obliged to fulfil your payment in lieu clause, by paying you monetary value for your company benefits such as paid leave, Christmas bonus, use of Land Rover and Pension scheme. <nl><nl>UDC Prospect <nl>It is unlikely WW will be able to defend your claim, unless they satisfy the tribunal’s requirements arguing they were fair and reasonable in dismissing you for one or more of the five reasons established in law and in doing so, they followed a fair dismissal procedure. Here the burden will be on WW to prove this and must also justify your resignation. If WW are unable to defend your resignation reasons (which I think is likely), you will succeed in arguing WW constructively dismissed you. <nl><nl>Applying this, WW may use ‘other substantial reason,’ ground to defend your dismissal; namely they incurred losses from your projects. Another fair reason WW may use to defend your dismissal may be ‘misconduct,’ regarding your work performance. This is unlikely to succeed, as WW would be required to follow ACAS Disciplinary Guidelines, such as opting for Mediation with you, before dismissing you. As with WDC, the tribunal would require evidence of your work performance from the last two-three years.<nl><nl>Whether you was dismissed withwithout notice, WW must prove they dismissed you following a fair and reasonable dismissal procedure. Here, after orally resigning you have not met with Narinder to further discuss your decision. As the employer, WW should have done this to ensure your dismissal was fair but because they did not, you are likely to be successful in arguing your UDC; as silence from your resignation was a negative response. <nl><nl>What are your options, and what would be the advantages and disadvantages of pursuing each option?<nl>Please find below a list of options available to you. <nl><nl>Option 1: Do not resign and tolerate Narinder’s behaviour.<nl><nl>Advantages:<nl>• You continue to have a regular job and income.<nl>• No stress about finding alternative work.<nl>• Saves time and money, as you will not spend thousands on your legal bill. <nl><nl>Disadvantage:<nl>• Narinder’s disrespectful behaviour may not change.<nl>• The reasonable time for you to resign and argue constructive dismissal from WW will pass. <nl><nl>Option 2: Do not resign, but seek an amicable solution to address Narinder’s behaviour. <nl><nl>Advantages: <nl>• Same as Option 1. <nl>• WW may appreciate your feedback, leading to improvements in Narinder’s behaviour. <nl>• WW may assign you a new line manager. <nl><nl>Disadvantage:<nl>• Same for Option 1, but hopefully this will not happen. <nl><nl>Option 3: Do not resign, but raise a grievance case against Narinder. <nl><nl>Advantages:<nl>• Same as option 2, however WW may consider this to be a drastic measure to take. <nl><nl>Disadvantage:<nl>• Same as Options 1-2. <nl><nl>Option 4: Hand in your notice but do not claim. <nl><nl>Advantages:<nl>• You will be free from Narinder’s treatment. <nl>• You will save time and money in bringing a claim against them.<nl>• You will receive all benefits you are entitled to during your notice period. <nl><nl>Disadvantages:<nl>• You will be unemployed after your notice period.<nl>• Stressful finding another job. <nl><nl>Option 5: Resign and argue constructive dismissal under WDC and UDC.<nl><nl>Advantages:<nl>• You will receive your entitled benefits had you worked your notice period. <nl>• You will feel happy seeing Narinder being disciplined for her behaviour.<nl>• Feel happy seeing WW negative publicity.<nl><nl>Disadvantages:<nl>• Same as Option 4.<nl>• There is no guarantee of winning which may waste your time and money. <nl><nl>I think Option 2 is beneficial to you, however it is your choice. <nl><nl>What remedies might you seek, and, if they include financial compensation, how much -providing figures where possible - is a court or tribunal likely to order Wildlife Wonders to pay out to you, should you succeed with each claim?<nl><nl>WDC<nl>The tribunal may award you financial compensation, an injunction andor declaration that WW wrongfully dismissed you. The tribunal is likely to award you compensation, as this suits your needs better because a declaration will financially damage WW more due to negative publicity. <nl><nl>Your compensation will be depend on if WW allow you to work your notice period or they pay you the monetary value of your entitled benefits instead. The tribunal will order WW to pay you 10 weeks’ worth salary (£10,000), as this is your legal notice period entitlement. This will include your benefits entitlements, namely your pension of approximately £4,000. Your notice will continue throughout the Christmas period, hence the tribunal will order WW to pay you your contractual Christmas Bonus (£1,560). As this is discretionary, the tribunal will order this, if you receive your ‘Christmas [bonus]’ regularly. If so, WW must pay your bonus, as this constitutes an employee contractual ‘right[s] to receive.’ <nl><nl>Currently, you have taken two days’ leave. I doubt you would taken more, during your notice. Legally, employers must compensate employees for untaken leave, because employers have benefitted from extra employee work. Therefore, the tribunal will award you 26 days’ worth salary (£3,703.96). To avoid this, WW may encourage you to take leave during your notice. <nl><nl>Your compensation totals £19,263.96. This includes notice salary (£10,000), Pension (£4,000), untaken leave (£3,703.96) and Christmas bonus (£1,560). Without Christmas bonus your compensation totals £17,703.96. Your desire to keep Land Rover may reduce your compensation. Subtracting the car, your compensation totals £11,763.96 or £10,203.96 without Christmas bonus. When negotiating with WW do not make it obvious you wish to keep the car. Given your strong reputation and to avoid publicity, WW may allow you to keep the car. If your accounting transfer increased your salary, the tribunal will order WW to pay the difference. Your overall compensation is below tribunal’s maximum award of £25,000. I advise you bring your WDC and UDC to a tribunal. <nl><nl>UDC<nl>The tribunal can lawfully re-instate you into your current job, with Narinder continuing as your manager. Or they may re-engage you into your current job, with a new manager and WW branch. The tribunal is unlikely to re-instate or re-engage you, as your relationship with WW is damaged. However, if you wish to be re-instated or re-engaged, the tribunal will consider this. <nl><nl>Your compensation will consist of basic and compensatory awards. <nl>Basic Award <nl>Tribunal will award you £6,300 based on your weekly gross salary (£525 cap), age, and 10 years of service. <nl><nl>Compensatory Award<nl>The maximum tribunal may award is your current gross salary (£78,000), as it is below £86,444 cap. This may be lower (£25,000), as this is fair, equitable; considering time taken to secure another job.<nl><nl>If both claims succeed, the tribunal will only award you compensation for UDC (£84,300) because this includes your salary and benefits lost during your notice. The tribunal may be inclined to reduce your compensation award, as early payments give you investment opportunities, but this is unlikely due to the Coronavirus recession. <nl><nl>Given your strong reputation, skills and compensation award, it is possible for you to create your own business providing you have no competitive restrictive covenants. The tribunal will consider this.  The tribunal will consider your skills, experience and how long it will take you to find another job. If you are currently looking for jobs and havewill attend an interview, please inform me because the tribunal will reimburse your expenses made, namely travel fee and newspapers subscriptions. <nl><nl>Additional information<nl>Please email me your employment contract, as I may identify further benefit entitlements and if WW can allow you to work your notice or pay you in lieu. If not, WW cannot enforce restrictive covenants and other clauses against you; for this invalidates your contract.<nl><nl>Please confirm if you have opted out of Working Time Regulations 1998, as this determines your ability to be compensated for untaken leave. <nl><nl>I leave you to reflect and will contact you for further instructions. <nl><nl>Yours Sincerely, <nl>", "<addr1_FN>,<nl><nl> <nl><nl>Thank you for sending me the meeting link and thank you for updating me on our written coursework.<nl><nl> <nl><nl>Is it possible for you to record tomorrow’s webinar, as I have a driving lesson then?<nl><nl> <nl><nl>I did try to avoid our webinar time, but with COVID and my instructor getting fully booked quickly I need to take whatever lesson offered, as I had to delay my test due to COVID.<nl><nl> <nl><nl>Kind Regards,<nl><nl><part_FN2>.<new>Hi <addr1_FN>,<nl><nl> <nl><nl>I hope you’re well.<nl><nl> <nl><nl>Thank you giving me feedback on my practice assessment.<nl><nl> <nl><nl>I’ve just noticed that the recording of my practice assessment is available to re-watch on <system1><system2>.<nl><nl> <nl><nl>Unfortunately I am uncomfortable with this, as I am concerned this will lead to other students watching my recording and use my responses in their work to plagiarise, which could penalise me unnecessarily, as I have not plagiarised especially if my real assessment will be in <month> compared to someone who would deliberately have their assessment in <month> to avoid being suspected of plagiarising my work.<nl><nl> <nl><nl>Therefore, is there any way you could password protect our videos to ensure only the moderator, yourself and the named student can access the recording of the video instead please?<nl><nl> <nl><nl>I think contacting I.T to arrange this may be helpful.<nl><nl> <nl><nl>Kind Regards,<nl><nl><part_FN2>.<nl><nl> <new>It’s okay.<nl><nl> <nl><nl>I’ll email you my query now and if I’m happy with the response then I’ll leave the <system> appointment for <day>.<nl><nl> <nl><nl>So with regards to the presentation assignment, I wanted to know if my arguments for Question 1 were appropriate.

{"id": "71391dcc-d110-4118-828a-0f9630ac0c6f", "discourse_types": ["essay", "memo"], "pair": ["Rationale:<nl>The research topic I am looking at links to the use of social media and what the possible consequences are, I chose to study this topic due to the wide use of social media and how much it has taken over what we do and how we live our lives. Social media is used in many ways such as for business purposes, marketing, cultural exchanges, news sources, etc. Most people in today’s society have access to at least a minimum of one social media platform due to the increased popularity in social networking, especially in the younger generation, but my research aims to look at how this may affect an individual. According to a survey conducted in 2018 by common sense media, 40% of teenagers aged between 13-17 claimed that keeping in contact with friends on social media daily is either \"extremely\" or \"very\" important. The main research question I am looking at is what is the impact of social media on an individual’s self-perception and relationship? This will be done by conducting a semi-structured interview, with the interview schedule being in the appendices, showing the development built from the main question. This includes the effects of social media for friendships relationships and families, how mental health can be damaged and looking at whether social media is seen as healthy or not. The method of analysis I have chosen for this research topic is discourse analysis, this is the most appropriate method, for the study I am conducting, as I am investigating the perception of social media and getting a better understanding at the individual’s views of social media rather than their life experiences. The name of the participant I interviewed will not be used to protect confidentiality, so I used the pseudonym Eliza. <nl><nl>Results:<nl><nl>Discourse 1- negativity of social media<nl>Eliza understands how much social media is used and how it does cause problems despite her lack of use of social media \"I rarely use social media\". Eliza portrays the discursive object as social media and the discourse of social media being negative. Eliza knows that social media is constantly being used and that people on social media may behave inappropriately leading to serious consequences. She understands the effects it can have on a person and the reason why people may behave this way. <nl><nl><data_extract><nl> <nl>Eliza realises that on social media people can act in a way that is not the same as how they behave in real life, but their actions can ultimately hurt the people they love. She explores that people use social media in the wrong way knowing that what they are doing is wrong however some people also get treated bad on social media for no reason and this can affect an individual due to increase of negativity. <nl><nl><data_extract><nl><nl>Eliza points out that not only does negativity affect communication between people but also interferes with how an individual feels about themselves, particularly through cyber-bullying which can destroy how someone might feel about themselves and make them feel low, therefore affecting how they behave. <nl><nl>Discourse 2- vital for families<nl>Eliza does share the good things of social media being that it helps keep people in connection with each other, mainly with families. Despite the risk of suffering bullying or negativity, some people may just use social media just as a form of contact to those they cannot get a reach of often or see in person.<nl><nl><data_extract><nl><nl>Eliza explains how social media is very beneficial to socialise for the right reasons to the right people, this is a common reason for Eliza using social media herself, to be able to interact with family and keep a strong bond from members of her family she might not see very often. This shows that although social media might not be a safe place, it does have positives for bringing people together and can in some ways create a stronger community amongst people. <nl><nl><data_extract><nl><nl>Eliza then goes on to discuss how social media can be a disadvantage with family members who might not allow freedom whilst on social media and watch over what they are doing, causing dispute between people. This is obviously seen as a disadvantage as people in the younger generation especially do not want to be supervised on what they do and who they talk to by relatives however, in other ways this can be seen as a good thing as by having family members on social media, this should stop people from posting something that may be inappropriate or offensive as parents can watch what their children are doing online. Eliza then goes on to talk about reputation and states \"oh, wait and also you might post things that goes against families\", this can vary between posting something that can go against religion, can be a hateful comment such as homophobia or a revealing picture that parents would not want other people seeing. This would therefore cause strains and arguments between family members as parents may try and be controlling but children may want some space for themselves. <nl><nl>Discourse 3- loneliness <nl>Eliza shared her thoughts on whether people who use social media tend to be lonely or not. She explained that is it common for people to use social media for company and may even talk to someone that they have not met before in real life. <nl><nl><data_extract><nl><nl>She claims that people do talk to people on social media due to lack in confidence in making friends which is becoming a problem for children as they might start to rely on talking to people online and causing them to lack the right skills to communicate with people in real life. She also mentions that people do it to make themselves feel better and more appreciated by having someone talk to them in a friendly manner. This goes against the points of being cyber-bullied showing that some people who might get bullied in real life rely on people on the internet to keep then happy. Eliza did suggest that not everyone uses social media due to feeling lonely but might use it because they could potentially be bored or still require more attention and people to talk to. Some people do have enough friends and families in their lives to talk to often but might get bored and want to use social media rather than actually feeling lonely.<nl><nl>Discourse 4- social media not healthy<nl>Eliza justified that social media can be healthy in some ways but may also be unhealthy and gave her views for both sides leading a balanced answer. She claimed that a lot of people use social media just for attention and to get people to start to notice them more which also makes them feel better and improve their self-esteem but in the wrong ways<nl><nl><data_extract><nl><nl>Eliza goes on to contradict herself by then saying it is healthy as individuals could use social media to seek help and people will reply to them in a way that makes them feel better. Some people find it easier to talk on social media and if that is their way of making themselves happier than it is being used in a healthy manner. Eliza basically claims that it is the mindset we have for using social media, some people use it to be needy and have people feel sorry for them and that is not a healthy way of using social media however Eliza thinks that letting out your problems is healthy when people do it to genuinely speak their mind and helps them to feel relieved.<nl><nl>Discussion:<nl>Eliza showed moments throughout the interview where she is against the use of social media and does not agree with how it is being used these days however, she also realises the importance of it. Through experience she realised that talking to family through social media is a great phenomenon which makes her feel content, she also brought on the fact that people who may need more support use social media widely to gain that support so can make people feel better. A study done in 2003 by Janet Morahan-Martin shows that individuals that are lonelier tend to use social media more for companionship and intimacy especially compared to those who are not so much lonely.<nl>Eliza shows the different people on social media who can either improve the well-being of an individual or make it worse depending on the type of person who uses social media. Some people care about individuals and do feel sincere about those who are troubled, and then some people feel joy about intimidating others through social media and have no guilt to tear apart friendships or relationships making social media an unsafe place. With the final discourse about whether social media is healthy or not, Eliza managed to show both points of views on whether it is accepted and beneficial or whether there are consequences, she stated it should only be used for the purposes of seeking help from anyone online and to relieve whatever pain, sadness or emotion they are feeling. The wrong way to do it is by lying or exaggerating on social media just to acquire a specific response or reaction from the people reading it.", "Dear CEO, Following the task you have given me, I have arranged your itinerary for your trip to Helsinki. I have booked for you to stay at Radisson Blu Seaside Hotel Helsinki as it has a great view of the seaside in front and is within your budget. For the 2 nights you requested it will cost Â£180 and includes breakfast if you choose to stay in. Close to the hotel is a cafe called Moko Market cafe &amp; store Punavuori which will give you a great variety of breakfast options and also happens to be closest to the seaside so you can enjoy a great view while having breakfast. This will roughly be a 4 minute drive from the hotel. 7 Minutes away from the hotel is an interesting museum called Paivalehti newspaper museum which had great reviews and will teach you a lot about Helsinki. Close to the hotel is a restaurant called Mekong Ravintola which is a 3 minute drive from the hotel, serves great food and is highly rated. The restaurant has a variety of foods so you will not have to worry about having issues with seafood. A great gift shop which is nearby is shop Helsinki Mikebon which is a souvenir shop that will have many items to choose from for your children. And lastly as you requested for a night out to enjoy, there is a great entertainment place called Storyville which is a jazz club. This place also serves meals and has a terrace area to enjoy the night life. This is approximately 7 minutes away from the hotel by car. Hopefully that is everything you are looking for and you enjoy your travel. Regards, PA."]}

{"id": "88d66d2d-f658-4200-86d6-0cbc700dd05e", "discourse_types": ["essay", "memo"], "pair": ["Over the last few years EMNE’s have become more prominent within the globalised world we now live in. These firms have had a significant boost since 2002; also referred to as the ‘going global era.’ They tend to come from emerging, upper-middle income economies and developing countries and use a variety of entry modes such as joint ventures, strategic alliances and wholly owned subsidiaries (Guillen &amp; Garcia-Canal, 2009). However, the majority choose to expand rapidly into developed countries using M&amp;A’s and are late movers. A growing number of EMNE’s are starting to dominate certain industries such as banking, telecommunications and engineering and outward FDI from emerging countries is increasing. For example, China has increased its presence within the Fortune 500 between 2004 and 2019; whilst the presence of US firms has started to decrease, showing the ever-growing dominance of EMNE’s (Fortune Global 500, 2004,2019). There’s several firms many of us from the western world may not have realised are owned by EMNE’s, such as Tetley being owned by TATA – an Indian conglomerate; meaning it owns several different types of businesses and McVitie’s being owned by Turkish EMNE, Yildiz Holding.<nl>This essay will highlight the key differences between MNE’s and EMNE’s and examine how effective current theories are at explaining outward FDI from emerging country multinationals and compare and contrast them to the more recent theories which have been developed; including the LLL model and Springboard theory. Some academics believe these new EMNE’s have different motivations, which don’t necessarily fit in with the traditional theories; whilst others think that these theories can be applied just as effectively as the newer ones. <nl>Key differences between traditional western MNE’s and EMNE’s<nl>Only a decade ago many EMNE’s, which are booming today and challenging some of the most established MNE’s in many industries, were marginal competitors. So how have they managed to do this in such a short space of time and be successful? It’s important to look at the key characteristics of both traditional MNE’s and the newer EMNE’s to see what makes them so different. A main difference is the speed they internationalise. Many traditional MNE’s expand gradually, following the Uppsala model whereby they expand into countries which are psychologically close considering factors such as, geography, shared language and shared cultures. On the other hand, EMNE’s expand at a more accelerated pace. They do this to close the gap between their market reach and the global presence of MNE’s from developed countries (Mathews, 2006). A good example of an EMNE which has expanded rapidly is Chinese firm Huawei. In just five years, despite starting as a domestic firm in 2001, it was operating in over 100 countries by 2006. It did this by providing solid technology at low prices and hiring low cost engineers at 20% of western rates. This allowed them to strongly compete against western MNE’s and expand quickly (Fey et al, 2016). EMNE’s also use latecomer advantage whereby they learn from mistakes of MNE’s already established in the market and do better themselves. MNE’s are essentially used as ‘guinea pigs.’ With regards to ownership advantages many MNE’s have the required resources available to them internally; making this a big advantage if they were to expand into developing countries. However, EMNE’s are sometimes seen as having weak ownership advantages, but many believe this is debatable as their institutional advantages are so strong and they can also just obtain resources and capabilities through M&amp;A’s; which would naturally upgrade their ownership advantages. <nl>Institutional advantages are another key element to consider when comparing the firms. It’s well documented that traditional MNE’s have struggled significantly in countries with institutional voids as they’re used to political stability; due to coming from countries with highly stable environments. As a result, they don’t have the same experiences to cope with instability in the same way as EMNE’S. New EMNE’s are known to have this as a big advantage over traditional MNE’s, as they’re used to dealing and complying with discretionary and unstable governments in their domestic countries, therefore meaning they’re better prepared to succeed in foreign countries with weak institutional environments (Cuervo-Cazurra &amp; Genc, 2008). It’s also believed that if EMNE’s can successfully thrive in unstable developing countries, they most certainly can be successful in stable, developed countries. Finally, there’s key differences in the organisational adaptability of MNE’s versus EMNE’s. It’s believed that EMNE’s are much more adaptable than MNE’s which tend to suffer from inertia, by being stuck in their ways, as they have deeply ingrained values, cultures and organisational structures (Guillen &amp; Garcia-Canal, 2009). Consequently, they tend to have lower success rates with M&amp;A’s due to their lack of adaptability - almost two thirds of acquisitions by western firms end in failure, as the acquirer doesn’t give flexibility to the firm acquired. On the other hand, EMNE’s tend to have a high M&amp;A success rate - 67% success rate, as their adaptability is high, and they appreciate the firm they acquire more; due to their lack of global presence. <nl>Existing theories and their relevance<nl>Two major theories which explain the existing ways firms expand overseas successfully are Dunning’s Eclectic Paradigm and the Uppsala Model. Dunning uses OLI theory to explain why firms use outward FDI; suggesting the key advantages as being ownership advantages, location advantages and internalisation advantages. Ownership advantages refer to valuable resources and capabilities a firm offers a country it expands into, which gives them a competitive advantage. Many argue that due to their lack of capabilities and resources, coming from developing countries, EMNE’s can’t satisfy this part of the OLI paradigm. Going by Dunning’s explanation this would mean that they’re unable to engage in outward FDI, however many still do and are proven successful. Furthermore, some believe EMNE’s from developing countries could be considered to have ownership disadvantages, as they lack a well-known image and may not have the ability to compete on the same scale as western MNE’s, who have larger finances and advanced technologies (Fey et al, 2016). In addition, location advantages are required by Dunning to expand overseas effectively; this is what host countries can offer to a firm undertaking FDI there (Dunning, 1979). However, many EMNE’s don’t go abroad to access location advantages, such as lower cost production, lower labour costs or cheaper technology; as they already have this available to them in their domestic markets. For example, many Chinese firms won’t outsource their production to a developed country if they’re to expand their firm into them, because it’s well documented that production and labour within China can be done at a much cheaper cost to say that in the US.  As both ownership advantages and location advantages aren’t satisfied in the OLI paradigm, it makes it possible to say that the theory could become redundant or less relevant as more EMNE’S become successful in developed markets; without having satisfied all three elements within the paradigm. <nl>Secondly, the Uppsala model is another model used to explain the internationalisation of firms. It emphasises how firms go abroad incrementally and increase commitments gradually. This may mean they go into countries close to their domestic market first. A firm may first export to a country, then open an overseas subsidiary and finally build or acquire their own factory abroad as they gain more knowledge about the market and establish their operations. EMNE’S are unfortunately thought to leapfrog some steps outlined above and may even start the internationalisation process by becoming ‘born global’ and setting up the factory first. According to Eriksson et al (2000), the Uppsala Model is based on the idea that the behaviour of the internationalisation process is path dependent. Path dependence is a process based on the accumulated knowledge from the firm’s past international experience, which directs the firm’s future trajectory (Eriksson et al, 2000). A main concern is that Uppsala explains this path dependence but EMNE’s have no experience in developed countries to use. As a result, they can only use knowledge of developing countries. On the other hand, MNE’s know all about operating in developed markets so are at a bigger advantage. Finally, part of the Uppsala model is the idea of psychic distance - entering countries psychologically close. A main issue with this idea is that EMNE’s may not be able to use psychic distance to enter developed countries because they’re so different in nature. For example, developing countries may have stronger cultural, language, political and legal differences to developed countries. This would also be the case for MNE’s looking to expand into developing countries. <nl>The development of new theories<nl>As time has progressed new theories have been developed to try to explain and analyse how these new EMNE’s have used outward FDI to expand their presence internationally. The reason for creating these theories is because many couldn’t understand how these firms from countries with weaker country specific advantages could compete against the firms from developed countries. At first glance, it appears these EMNE’s have weaker firm specific advantages compared to their western rivals. <nl>The springboard theory was created (Luo and Tung, 2007) to explain why these firms expand so aggressively and the drivers behind this. The theory highlights seven elements. The first being that EMNE’s use their international expansion to compensate for their ownership disadvantages; this means that to counteract the fact they can’t offer a lot initially in terms of resources to the new market, they expand internationally and benefit from other means such as gaining resources from another firm through a M&amp;A. Immediately, this makes the OLI paradigm seem less relevant, as it’s highlighting that they can still be a success without initial ownership advantages. The second element of the theory says that EMNE’s use the international expansion to overcome their latecomer disadvantage; this means that they benefit from being able to see where MNE’s have made mistakes and ensuring they don’t make the same ones. Next, it explains that MNE’s from developing countries use international expansion as a springboard to counter-attack global rivals’ major foothold in their home country market. It also outlines that EMNE’s use outward FDI as a springboard to bypass certain trade barriers, such as quotas and anti-dumping penalties. This means that they go into another developingemerging markets with fewer restrictions. For example, if a Chinese firm were to set up a foreign subsidiary or production in Mexico and then export their good to the US. This again goes against the OLI paradigm as the firm isn’t directly using the location advantages of the US for production in the example above. Instead, they’re choosing to use those of Mexico to then sell in the US. Furthermore, the theory says new emerging MNE’s expand internationally to alleviate domestic institutional constraints. This for example could be if their home country doesn’t have strong patent laws, so they take their product elsewhere to be better protected therefore, benefitting from the county’s location advantage of having stronger patent protection. The final two elements explain that EMNE’s use international expansion to both secure preferential treatment offered by emerging governments and exploit their competitive advantage in other markets. To secure preferential treatment a domestic firm, say an Indian firm, may set up a subsidiary within the UK and then invest back into India to gain the tax benefit and the preferential government treatment. <nl>A second new theory developed is the LLL model (Mathews, 2006). This model has similarities to the Springboard theory in the way it explains why EMNE’s expand and internationalise. However, the key takeaway is that it says EMNE’s go abroad and then they learn. This is a massive contrast to the Uppsala model which emphasises the gradual process of expansion and firms using the knowledge they already possess to expand into markets with similarities, that are psychologically close. Firms going abroad and then learning highlights a more aggressive approach to expansion.  The three L’s in the model stand for linkage, leverage and learning. The linkage element examines the collaborations between EMNE’s and foreign firms through entry modes such as joint ventures, M&amp;A’s and alliances. Leverage explains that EMNE’s exploit global linkages to become ‘latecomers’ by harnessing resources and cost advantages to compete globally.  The second ‘L’ really highlights the idea that firms go abroad and then learn from the foreign partners already in the market and demonstrates why Dunning’s theory is less relevant of initially having certain ownership advantages to be successful. Finally, the learning element is the stage where EMNE’s acquire competitive advantages and learn how to compete internationally. Firms don’t need initial advantages necessarily; as they can expand and then learn and therefore become competitive. Overall, this model argues that firms acquire resources and learn over time before internationalisation occurs and the EMNE is integrated into the international activities. <nl>Although these theories have been developed and are more tailored to the new types of EMNE’s, they do still have their drawback such as underestimating the importance of absorption capacity and they go against the path dependence theory; as expressed in the Uppsala model. Finally, it’s clear that the importance of ownership advantages is dismissed; which is a key element in the existing OLI paradigm. <nl>In summary, it’s evident EMNE’s and traditional MNE’s differ both in the way they operate and the way they internationalise. Key differences include the speed EMNE’s internationalise compared with MNE’s and how differently they use or even don’t use their initial ownership advantages to ensure success abroad. Although they have their differences, both types of firm have proven to be successful in their own ways. However, there’s still a huge question mark over how these newer EMNE’s have prevailed so much globally. Thus, newer theories have been developed to try and explain this dominance. It must be said that although these new theories more accurately explain the rapid growth of EMNE’s and why having ownership advantages isn’t as essential as some older theories may suggest; they do still have their criticisms, as explained above. Consequently, further theories may have to be developed which are more accurate and less open to scrutiny. However, it really depends on individual views as to which theories are considered more relevant. Some would argue Dunning and the Uppsala model have been used for many years and can still be used effectively today, whilst others may say the world is constantly changing, as seen with the recent rise of EMNE’s, and therefore it’s necessary to keep developing and updating new theories. This will make them most effective and relevant to the current situations firms and countries find themselves in. For example, Carl Fey and others developed a new 5M framework which guides academics in their understanding of the internationalisation of EMNE’s (Fey et al, 2009). It proved that internationalisation is challenging for any firm. The largest challenge for EMNE’s, which is not always covered by the older theories, is overcoming the problem of a negative country image (Y.Y.

It’s the job of newer theories to potentially provide insight into how EMNE’’s can overcome this challenge.", "Hi Sophie, I have compiled a itinerary of all the things you would want to do on your trip to Helsinki for your two-day conference on the 2nd-4th September. Firstly, I have found a hotel called the Radisson Blue seaside hotel as i know you like the water and would want to be near it, this hotel is only 1 mile away from the Hetrikani beach and has stunning ocean views from the room. it is Â£77 a night within your budget and has many features such as AC, barlounge, a gym in case you would want to blow off any steam from the conference. It has many positive reviews and is deemed one of the best in Helsinki! It also is near many great sights so travelling will be very convenient. It is 6 mins from a museum as well as 2 mins from a escape room in case you would want to partake any other activities during your trip. The cafe I found for you to have breakfast at is called Eckberg cafe and is only a 12 min walk away from the hotel and they have many positive reviews and the images of the food also look amazing! The national museum of Finland are home to many artefacts and feature a great deal of history which will be perfect for you to get to know the history of the place and is only a 20 minute metro journey from the hotel, with the metro also near the hotel, perfect for travelling there! In terms of the restaurant, I found the restaurant Olo for you, it has a unique ambience with amazing food and are cautious with dietary requirements as I know you are allergic to shellfish. This restaurant is also close by to the hotel being 19 mins away! The lioporo gift shop is also home to some amazing handmade souvenir and typical souvenirs so you can get authentic gifts for your children, and again this is all close by so you don't have to worry about not having time due to your busy schedule! Finally, I know you wanted a nice live music venue to wind down in the evenings and I have found the Tavasata which is the no.1 live music venue in Helsinki and is described as legendary and iconic and is only 6 mins away! I will confer with you later about all these places and I hope they are to your liking. Best wishes, Sobia"]}

{"id": "4a020dfa-1dd1-49b0-845e-7bfe39bfc33f", "discourse_types": ["essay", "text_message"], "pair": ["The introduction to this essay will explain doping as a form of corruption and will cite statistics to convey the extent of its effect on sport. This will be accompanied by an examination of what the spirit of sport is. This essay's critical debate aims to expose WADA's ineffectiveness in ensuring that the spirit of sport triumphs over the doping corruption. In this regard, WADA's loose grip on national and sport’s governing bodies can be seen to disrupt clean athletes. The debate then will shift to how WADA's code is fundamentally discriminatory against athletes from developing countries, causing less privileged athletes to face harsher realities for the committing the same offences as their contestants. These problems are exacerbated by corruption in different countries where the punishments handed down by authorities do not reflect the crimes. The eventual finding is that WADA is unsuccessful because it lacks necessary authority. This essay will also offer a critique of the proposal of legalised doping, shedding light on its shortcomings. It will be concluded that an increase in WADA’s power is required for the spirit of sport. The conclusion is that WADA will only be able to promote the spirit of sport effectively when they are the final arbiter in enforcing the code. This essay includes insights from Sports science, medicine, sociology, ethics, psychology and economics to support its claims.<nl>Corruption is defined as ‘dishonest or illegal behaviour, especially of people in authority’. Gorse and Chadwick suggest corruption in sport includes illegal, immoral or non-ethical activities, which intentionally seek to distort the outcome of a sports competition for one or more parties' personal benefit. , Gorse and Chadwick analysed 2,089 cases of corruption in sports, where doping was present in 95.64% of cases.<nl>The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) is responsible for leading a collaborative worldwide movement for doping-free sport. They stress that anti-doping programmes foster the ‘spirit of sport’ which includes values like ethics, joy, education, health and fair play. According to the World Anti-Doping Code (WADC), doping is contrary to the spirit of sport, so impressions of sporting achievement are important. When an athlete achieves success, it is helpful that their performances are not overshadowed by scepticism. The Sport of cycling can be used as an example.<nl>Reeth and Lagae surveyed if doping was acceptable among different demographics in the cycling community. They reported a clear view that doping contradicts the spirit of fair play. When Chris Froome became the first Briton to win the Tour de France twice, his second victory was marred by doping allegations. Froome was eventually proven innocent, but there is no doubt that the distrust created by Lance Armstrong made public scepticism inescapable for anyone that proceeded him. From a sociological point of view, this proves that the social significance of any sport is heavily reliant on its winning athletes. These winners are currently expected to work honestly for their accomplishments. This might be done by training hard simply with a special talent. However, the vital spirit of sport is undermined if the organisation which regulates anti-doping is unsuccessful in doing so.<nl>It is very possible that chalking Armstrong’s wins did nothing to solve the problems he created. When he became the first cycling colossus, he grew to establish a legacy that would see his accomplishments rise in importance as the sport's history evolves and more athletes fail to better him. That became a double-edged sword when anti-doping campaigns erased these victories, thus profoundly undermining the sport's past and underlying spirit. A relentless scepticism of innocent winners could also turn athletes away from the sport, fearing the scrutiny their lives would face if they had any success. Surely any failure to solve this issue could damage the spirit of a sport and this failure can be traced back to WADA?<nl><nl>Clean athletes often lose out<nl>The WADC exists to maintain a fundamental right to compete in doping-free competition. This is why, if the WADC fails, any athlete who competes clean suffers the consequences. It is often the case that those who win are recalled, occasionally with a thought for second and third place, while those who finish below the podium positions sometimes fade into obscurity. These individuals forfeit the life-changing status and wealth that comes with success because they miss out on awards to dishonest athletes who dope. It is therefore important WADA ensures ‘clean athletes don’t suffer the devastation of stolen medal moments’. <nl>Unfortunately, many athletes have already been affected by this calamity. The Associated Press estimated that $410,000 could be owed to thousands of athletes because of only four track and field players who never returned their prize money from the Olympic Games after being caught doping.  Athletes are also sometimes given a cash sum by their country for placing well in a sporting event. Moreover, those that do not make it to the podium are deprived of recognition; Jo Pavey, who finished fourth in the 10,000m at the 2007 World Championships, was still waiting for her bronze medal nearly a decade later. <nl>When it comes to fixing these injustices, WADA loses out just as much. Appeals to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) can currently be made to recover an athlete’s losses, but the views of CAS rarely align with WADA’s recommendations. On top of that CAS also risks having its own decisions set aside by the Swiss Federal Court. The current format then receives criticism because many of its legal efforts have focused disproportionately on the suspected athlete’s right to fair process, meaning they fail to provide clean athletes with the attention they deserve. On the other hand, there are reasons why suspected athletes deserve reasonable legal process, such as mitigating factors. Goalkeeper Andre Onana was recently suspended for mistakenly taking a painkiller that turned out to be a banned substance. Although it is the athletes' duty to ensure that no banned substance enters their bodies, ignoring defendants entirely in favour of clean athletes does not seem like the most reasonable alternative. <nl>That being said, allowing implicated athletes from Russia to compete in the 2016 Olympics, did nothing to convey any consequences of doping on a national scale. When the IOC refused to follow any of WADA's guidelines on Russia it showed a blatant disregard for the spirit of sport and for the right to compete in doping-free sport. Likewise, the decisions of CAS have been criticised for being inconsistent and still allowing corrupt athletes to participate. Despite CAS’ shortcomings, it is nevertheless the responsibility of the WADC to provide guidance on these matters, but rules for state endorsed doping did not exist at the time. Critics have argued that not addressing that issue was ‘… the most detrimental aspect of the Code’.<nl>One might then argue WADA's inability to protect all athletes who participate clean does not imply that they are the sole culprit, since this would set an impossibly high standard for WADA. However, when the authors of the universal anti-doping rule do not agree with the enforcers, it creates a divide between the different anti-doping authorities to the detriment of any clean athlete. More recently it was reported that WADA has opened a formal investigation into UK Anti-Doping for enabling British Cycling to conduct its own investigation into one of its riders. This supports the idea that WADA's lack of authority when imposing the spirit of sport is frequently amplified by the missteps of National and Sports Governing Bodies.<nl><nl>There is not a ‘level playing field’<nl>It may also be argued that the current anti-doping approach does not account for the differences caused by the various settings in which athletes live. This means there is not a fair playing field in sport. Firstly, it is not considered an unfair advantage to live in a wealthy country, yet athletes that do have a significant edge over their rivals from developing countries. Kayser and others argue that these conditions can sometimes come close to doping. <nl>Scholars from developing countries have argued that reaching a world class status in sports often reflects excellent equipment and facilities. Despite this, sport is not a top priority in any developing state. Research suggests that these countries instead rely on imported goods and sponsorships to provide amenities. The outcome is that athletes cannot become involved in ‘sophisticated doping’ in the same way as their competitors since they often lack the resources. Sports facilities in emergent countries are often not maintained because of their financial costs. Consequently, their usage is reduced which leads to a smaller number of local sports competitions. Further, UNESCO suggested in 2013 that there were considerable widespread shortfalls in the quality and quantity of facility and amenity provision, especially in low income countries. For that reason it would be absurd to conclude that talents from developing nations are ever really on a fair playing field, even from a young age. <nl>Corruption in developing countries such as Kenya only compounds these issues. WADA recognised that the doping practices of Kenyan athletes are ‘unsophisticated, opportunistic, and uncoordinated’. This is because testing techniques for older, well-known substances such as Erythropoietin (EPO) are well established meaning its users are easier to spot. The problem is that anti-doping tests are not equally as effective for athletes with access to newer substances. The comparatively unsophisticated doping practises of Kenyan athletes means they are typically caught, and therefore penalised, more often than their competition. This goes to show that a level playing field hardly ever exists.<nl>Operation Aderlass demonstrated these problems in action. In endurance sports, autologous blood doping (ABD), which allows athletes to supply more oxygen to their muscles, has been a big advantage for athletes until discovery., Only then did endurance athletes own up to doing it, probably because they felt that they would be singled out eventually. By contrast, some of Kenya’s highest profile athletes have been identified and banned from their sports because their doping practises were easier to identify. This demonstrates that not all cheaters are treated equally, not because some have committed more serious crimes than others, but because they are committing the same crime with less success.<nl>It may be argued that the nature of this imbalance seriously undermines whether anti-doping efforts are worthwhile and whether they help the spirit of sport. However, it is unfair to expect authorities to always be on top of doping. Still, WADA's anti-doping programmes aim to maintain sport's level playing field. When only certain athletes can use doping to their advantage, these ideals are damaged. As a result of this inequality, talented athletes from developed countries are forced to pursue other opportunities, and the sport suffers the consequences. Ultimately the disparity in doping practises also creates confusion around winners, making it difficult for people to trust whether achievements are the result of hard work or corruption. These are problems that WADA must resolve if it wants to restore confidence in the spirit of sport and offer better opportunities to athletes from developing countries who may risk being left behind if they compete clean.<nl><nl>WADA cannot enforce consequences<nl>'Operation Puerto' in Spain exemplified how WADA has frequently been obstructed in addressing its concerns. Multiple athletes were involved in this sandal. The Criminal Court of Madrid ruled that the evidence discovered by police should be destroyed, a verdict that WADA later challenged. Its former director general, David Howman, argued that ‘at times it seemed as if the intention was to delay any proper approach’. WADA were also unable to name the implicated athletes due to their own statute of limitations policy. <nl>The inability to reveal these facts proves that perceptions of achievement can sometimes be distorted to shield athletes at all costs. In the 2000s, Spanish athletes were worshiped as long as they continued to make Spain a sporting powerhouse (Soule and Kudovic 2011). Dr Fuentes confessed that his clients included athletes from many different sports. One might then argue that Spain and WADA still bear the same burden as in 2006: exposing the facts. A failure to do so not only casts doubt on those in power, but it also calls into question their ability to enforce the WADC. As a consequence, one might argue the values enshrined in the spirit of sport are abandoned at the price of one country.<nl>The implications of Operation Puerto still pale in comparison to those of Russia's state-led anti-doping regime. It involved the director of the anti-doping laboratory in Russia creating a mixture of banned substances that he gave to dozens of Russian athletes, enabling the most controversial doping scheme in history. While WADA endorsed a ban of 4 years, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) substituted a 2 year ban. It also repealed a WADA provision that would have forced Russian athletes to make clear that they were not involved with the scheme. The US anti-doping agency chief suggested the ruling was ‘a catastrophic blow to clean athletes, the integrity of sport, and the rule of law.’<nl>For many this has made it clear that WADA is a substandard organisation when it comes to enforcing its own code. In many countries, WADA must depend on the authorities' willingness to implement effective anti-doping policies and it is clear this scarcely happens. Furthermore, the implementation of the code is contingent governing bodies’ ability to punish the guilty parties for their violations of the code. Instead, these organisations often fall short of their responsibilities, raising doubts about their ability to enforce the code in light of the spirit of sport. This can only come back to bite WADA who are trapped in a vicious circle of making suggestions and not being listened to.<nl>Where it is vital that WADA intervenes it must rely on independent bodies, who have failed to be as unsparing as many would have hoped when bringing the Kremlin to book. Further to that, reinviting Russia's competitors to international competition under the guise of being ‘neutral athletes’ provides no evidence of any real repercussions for sport's most notorious doping scandal. What else could justify a ban on Russian athletes if a state-led doping programme cannot? As a direct result, sporting spirit often is forfeited in the blink of an eye, and it often appears that WADA's eyes are held shut due to their lack of authority. <nl><nl>Legalising doping is flawed<nl>It is only fair that critics of the current approach present alternative views about how doping can be better managed with the aim of promoting the spirit of sport. In that regard doping is difficult to regulate since most appropriate behaviours today can be considered as corrupt in the future. <nl>Some commentators recommend a supervised doping practise. There is a surplus of information on this subject which far exceeds the scope of this essay. The concept, though, can be narrowed down to a few key points: doping cannot be sufficiently safe as long as it is illegal, declaring that doping is unsafe becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy to some degree, since doping often occurs without adequate medical monitoring. They propose allowing medically controlled doping would provide a more solid basis for sports physicians to exercise their duty and fulfil their health-care obligations.<nl>While it is true that theories like principlism in medical ethics place high emphasis on autonomy and non-maleficence, and it is reasonable to believe that legalising doping could further these values, this essay argues that the dangers of controlled doping still outweigh the benefits. Indeed, these principles provide a method to define moral problems rather than provide answers. To begin with it is questionable whether more studies and funding on doping practises will lead to a lower risk to health. Despite decades of research live-saving drugs used to treat sepsis still carry high risks such as becoming deaf. As such, the proposal to minimise the risks associated with doping may be futile, since the current risks are already quite serious.<nl>It would also be difficult to define at what age someone can dope. The response is a proposal to prohibit competitive sports for children to avoid ethical dilemmas. This is obviously unrealistic, given that no nation will produce world class athletes unless young people participate in competitive sports. This moral dilemma is only complicated by athletes with pre-existing medical conditions. Sportspersons with polycystic kidney disease (PKD) have an inherited condition that causes numerous cysts in the kidneys. EPO, a common doping agent, is also produced in the kidneys. The problem is that EPO production is disrupted for these athletes, putting them at a disadvantage. Athletes with PKD would therefore suffer a great degree of inequality if EPO doping was legal. Anyone genetically predisposed to congenital heart condition (they are relatively common) could also be adversely affected by lots of performance enhancing drugs - by stressing the myocardium in such individuals they would be prone to potentially fatal arrhythmia. <nl>Therefore, it is argued that legalising a controlled doping practise would produce perhaps as much injustice as the current system. Sport can, however, proceed in several ways without facilitating the use of substances. The first sub-two-hour marathon ran by Eliud Kipchoge demonstrates how the use of mechanical help can produce new records. For cycling, athletes could use mechanically assisted bikes to help with hilly terrain. This is much safer than doping, however it is WADA that really needs to change.<nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>It has been argued that WADA’s actions have not contributed to the sporting spirit. WADA should have a much bigger say on the enforcement of the code, because its suggestions are often discarded by organisations for whom the spirt of sport is not always a significant objective. The proposal of controlled doping is not a suitable alternative. In the end, if the authors of the universal anti-doping rules are eventually made the ultimate arbiter, it will create an effective governing organisation with more power to actively ensure the spirit of sport.", " they might not have done csuse I've not seen a post about it<new>Can't believe she's pregnant tho<new>Life's moving too fast now<new>i got my <module> mark back and i have once again flopped from getting a first<new>64<new>im flabbergasted all he did was leave comments saying 'good'<new>give me 100 then <pers_FN><new><pers_SN> only just emailed me back<new>mans deadline is today<new>im about to have a look but to be fair ive made so many changes since i submitted that sample that his feedback will probs not be very useful now<new>i stand corrected his feedback was quite decent"]}

{"id": "494fbbef-2fd6-4dc9-a3e2-4ab7169a3733", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Background Information<nl>Superdrug are a UK health and beauty retailer and the second largest behind competitor Boots plc, with 900 stores across the UK and Ireland and a few European countries. In 2016 it became the UK’s fastest growing retailer in its industry, doubling its profit in the previous year. Superdrug have employed over 14,000 people across all their locations. In 2011 they launched their loyalty card as part of their ‘Take another look’ campaign and in 2015 the card was re-branded and given a new name. Presently, the loyalty card has seen a decline in the past 3 years, with less customers signing up our using their card.<nl>Aims and Objectives<nl>From the brief we understand that the overall aim of this proposal is to regain numbers in your loyalty programme and make sure that they remain consistent or rise in the long-term. Therefore, the overall objective, of this study is to investigate the cause of the decline in Superdrug’s loyalty program. This proposal will identify factors contributing to the loyalty decline in order for the marketing team to begin working on plausible solution. Some key questions that should be asked are:<nl>• Are members of the loyalty program currently satisfied with the program?<nl>• Are the current marketing efforts effective?<nl>• Why have some customers abandoned the program? What did they not like about the pro-<nl>gram?<nl>Research Design<nl>The study will consist of one quantitative and one qualitative method. The first part of the study will target customers that have left the loyalty scheme within the past 3 years. The aim is to discover why they chose to unsubscribe from the program. This will be the qualitative part of the study; a focus group, consisting of 10-15 participants, across the UK and Ireland. We recommend that the participants are as widespread as possible to avoid bias and display representation. As Focus groups are costly, we thought that we should start with a small sample to begin with, if this study proves useful it can be carried over to other European countries where Superdrug operates. The quantitative part of the study will focus on current members of the program, highlighting marketing efforts that encouraged them to join the programme and discovering whether they are currently satisfied with its offering. This information will be sought via an online questionnaire. Both stages of research will use an incentive to encourage participants to take part in the research. The reason why we would like to approach the study this is way is to gain an in-depth but representative understanding of the research problem.<nl>Research Method<nl>Qualitative Research<nl>It is unlikely that the participants would travel far for something like this, so we suggest that phone interviews are conducted. Each interview would last approximately 10-15 mins, as research has shown that this is the average time that customers would be willing to take<nl> <nl>part in this type of interview. The questions will be a mix of open-ended and closed questions allowing some quantifiable answers as well as thoughts and opinions which are equally valuable. The incentive provided could be a generous discount of 50% off all purchases at Superdrug for the next 6 months. The data will be collected, and content analysed.<nl>Quantitative Research<nl>This is supporting research to the phone interviews. Essentially, we are looking at conducting a survey for all shoppers, targeting a response rate of 200 participants, using a 15% discount as an incentive to respond. The participants will be gathered from the mailing list of beauty card users in the UK and Ireland. The survey will ask questions related to their overall experience of being a card user, from what marketing tools encouraged them to sign up to if they would recommend the service and an overall numerical rating of the service. The responses will be collected and analysed by a computer system.<nl>Sampling technique<nl>The sample of Customers are a mix of previous and current program users. The aim is to identify the similarities between the groups likes and dislikes about the program which should help identify the causes for the program’s decline. The telephone interviews should consist of female participants ranging from age 14-25 (they’re main target audience). Superdrug should contact participants via email, which should be stored in their database.<nl>Consider potential methods for data analysis<nl>The telephone interviews will be analysed using thematic coding. Using the interview transcripts, the responses will be sorted into broad themes and the number of times these appear will be recorded in a tally. The highest scoring ‘theme’ will be an indication as to the cause. This can be correlated with the answers received from the survey. As for the survey, all answers can be calculated via a computer, which can later be converted into bar charts or other visual graphs for easy presentation to management teams.<nl>Ethical conduct<nl>In both cases it is Important to get consent from all participants. In particular the participants of the telephone interview, who are ex-loyalty card users, there should be no harassment from the interviewer nor should the participant be made to feel bad for their decision to leave the program. All participants need to be made aware beforehand that the interview will be recorded, allowing them the opportunity to withdraw if they choose. For all participants taking part in the survey, terms and conditions outlining what the data will be used for should be agreed to. For participants that are under the age of 18, it should be made clear that a parent needs to consent to the terms and conditions.", "<addr12_FN>,<nl><nl>I can only apologise.

Firstly, Hotel Haven has a superior room between the 2nd and 4th of September, a 30-minute drive from the airport into the city centre. The hotel is the closest to the water that I could find, averaging Â£163 a night. The room also includes a \"great\" breakfast, as booking.com states; however, local cafes are available if you wish to venture out. Cafe Roasberg serves \"The Best\" Coffee and is a hotspot for breakfast options within a distance from the hotel. Roasberg is a 10 minute walk8 minute bus9minute car journey from the hotel. For local cuisine options, I discovered Kalerian Stew, a traditional meat dish that combines pork and beef, and no seafood ingredients are included. Konstan Molja is famous for its stew in Helsinki, and the restaurant is a 21 minute walk8 minute drive16-minute bus from the hotel. Regarding museums to explore the city's history, the national museum of Finland explores the regions past and cultural heritage. This is a 21 minute walk6 minute drive12-minute bus from the hotel. Souvenir shops conveniently surround the hotel, and I have chosen Kankurin Tupa, a 6-minute walk around the corner. They appear to have a large selection of items which I'm sure you'll be able to find something suitable for your children. Finally, G Livelab in Helsinki is an 8 minute walk4 minute drive from the hotel and has good wine and cocktails available. Along with this, numerous reviews state that they have a good atmosphere, and although they are primarily a live music venue, they host the occasional improv comedy night for 10 Euros. I hope this all sounds appealing to you. Xian Mullard", "<addr14_FN>,<nl><nl> <nl><nl>That’s completely understandable, must be a busy time!

{"id": "e0d46117-077f-4cd1-a3bf-d3807120c2cc", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Introduction <nl>The transformation from the original labour party to the New Labour party is a significant period in British political history. It was the introduction of a new ideology with similar social democratic values as the past but with the advantage of taking account the changes in the modern era; economically and socially etc. The following essay will focus mainly on the transformation since the 1990s with some reference to the past Labour party that originated before the 1990s. Also, the essay will specifically look at the domestic policies rather than foreign policies. The impact made can be split into focusing on the three main sectors; Health, education and Law &amp; Order. The essay will be discussing whether there has been a major shift in parties or whether it is the same but just holds a new name. Further analysing the positive and negative outcome of this development. Taking into consideration whether there will be a return of new labour. <nl><nl>What is the ‘Old’ Labour party? <nl>The beginning of the Labour party was in the 1900s (Reid, 1995). The main principle being the ‘Labour party’ was to take care of the industrial workers during the Queen Victoria Era.. They wanted to protect the rights of the working class who were thought to have different rights in comparison to those in higher classes and simply treated unfairly. The first Labour government wasn't formed till 1924 when prime minister Ramsey McDonald was in power. In the beginning, the Labour party started with only a few members. As a new party forming it was difficult to make decisions on whether the public should publicly make a stand on certain decisions. One of these was to make the ‘people’ only the centre of attention. Hence introducing \"reforms to improve working conditions and working-class living standards\" (Vickers, 2004).The support towards the ‘people’ influenced the votes. One of the influences of the ideology behind the Labour party is Socialist thinking. For instance, in the past, the Labour party used socialist theory to influence the formations of foreign policy (Vickers, 2004). This socialist or social-democratic way of thinking encouraged the Labour party to promote, the values of common ownership and equal opportunity. <nl> <nl>Labour is the second most popular party in the United Kingdom right after the Conservative party (The right-wing of the British political spectrum). Even in the 20th century, the Labour parties’ values are still influenced by this socialist thinking. Most of the support and popularity the party gains is because, of its anti-capitalist position. Most new members of the Labour party in 2015 were seen as \"left behind\" by society because their view did not agree with those on the right of the political spectrum and have been deceived those on the left who feel ‘left behind’ and have been deceived by the developments of globalization which has caused social inequality (Whiteley et al., 2018). <nl>Currently, in 2019 Britain is under the conservatives – the right of the political spectrum. With <nl>the general elections scheduled to take place in December 2019, Labour is striving to get the nation on its side. Jeremy Corbyn; Leader of the Labour party and the rest of his party clearly states their vision. Within every policy set, the vision embedded is \" for the many, not the few\"(Labour party, 2019). This shows how the party is still upholding the original values it first held in the 19th century by promoting the values of equality rather than focusing on one group. <nl><nl>What is the ‘New’ Labour party? <nl>New Labour was introduced as the face of the 'new' Labour party introduced by then Prime Minister, Tony Blair. After 18 years of Britain being under the power of the conservatives, the nation finally saw the Labour party return (O'Broin, 1997). Tony Blair of Scottish origin became prime minister on the 2nd of May in 1997 after John Major had resigned. The party introduced the ideology of \"New Labour\" which focused on bringing a new approach to modernise the economy by finding a middle ground between traditional socialism and the free market economy. This is also known as the ‘third way’. Moving it from the left of the political scale to the centre. <nl>The \"Labour Party Manifesto\" of 1997 said that New Labour rejected the old approaches of \"the old left and those of the Conservative Right\" (Labour-party.org.uk, 1997). It looked for a new way that would appeal to everyone rather than just one perspective. The parties manifesto promised constitutional change and looked at improving services important to the public like the NHS service and finding new ways to help troubled students mainly in deprived areas. This quickly increased Blairs' popularity amongst not only the sick but those in education too. Also, Blair was able to heavily adjust the Policies revolving the law to keep the nation safe therefore he was supported by the general public. <nl>However, his popularity did not last long. Even though Blair attempted to change the face of Labour in a positive way some of his reforms came across as quite radical. For instance, in 1998 university students were asked to pay for tuition fees. Most Students to this day only remember him as the prime minister who re-introduced tuition fees. Other controversial issues just like this pressurised Blair into resigning as prime minister on the 27th of June in 2007 (Blair, 2007). <nl>The New Labour period carried on until 2010 with the aid of prime minister Gordon Brown but after 2010 prime minister David Cameron was appointed and Britain returned to the power of the conservatives (Heffernan, 2011).<nl> <nl>What are the similarities? <nl>New Labour in some perspectives can be seen as \"Continuous with ‘Old’\" (Allender, 2001). Even though the party has reintroduced itself as a new ideology it still promotes the same values as ‘old' Labour but instead, it has adapted to the modern world. The outcomes that the Labour party wants to achieve are still similar but the processes have changed. For example, instead of simply giving people what they want, they encouraged people to improve themselves and to find work. <nl>New Labour still concentrates on \"fairness and social justice\" (Temple, 2000).The Labour party was built originally on the idea that everyone deserves the same opportunities. Therefore, Blair was able to introduce a minimum wage in 1998(O'Hara, 2018). This way no one is paid incorrectly and instead, the pay was in alliance with the cost of living in the society, However, some may argue not everyone is treated equally because the pay depends on the individuals' age. Each age group has a different set of minimum wages. So instead it has caused further inequalities. <nl>According to an article written by the guardian, these pledges New Labour was making were what \"Labour had been making for decades and had failed in the past to keep\" (The Guardian, 2005). Therefore, supporters of New Labour could argue that in fact, it was just a party that was taking care of 'Old' Labours' reputation. They were not able to fulfil the promises made to the nation in the past. So New Labour was responsible for damage control and making sure that the Labour name was not tarnished. <nl>Unfortunately for many, one of the sad similarities is that both parties still brought Labour down. Through their time in parliament, they did not fully satisfy the nation. Before New Labour came into power, Britain thought they had hope in this new party since the previous Labour government had left them feeling \"betrayed\" (BBC News, 2010). Even though this huge support brought a rise in New Labour they suffered a fall too when there were economic crises such as the \"credit crunch\" and increases in \"income tax\". <nl><nl>What are the differences? <nl>The main difference that is widely focused on is the \"‘modernisation’ element\" which it had done to \"catch up with the times\". (Allender, 2001).This is important for a political party that wants to gain support from the nation. This does not only apply for the elder generations but also for the youth who are seeing the changes to the nation. Therefore, they would be more inclined to vote for a party that looks at the modern aspects rather than the old. <nl>When Labour was not doing as good in terms of gaining interest, a decision was made to start changing and abandoning the traditional aim of only supporting the working class. So, there was a shift from being at the left of the political meter to the centre(Allender, 2001). New Labour no longer wanted to focus on just the working class thus widening its support group. <nl>Different periods meant different types of thinking had to be introduced. This explains why after the second world war \"Keynesian\" ethics were correct to use or after Thatcher left power it was time to adapt to neoliberal ideologies (Allender, 2001). Blair decided to amend clause IV which meant it disassociated Labour from socialist thinking. It did this by starting to reduce \"trade union power and influence within the Labour movement\" (Robinson, n.d.). Thus, focusing more on the consumers rather than producers. <nl>\"Tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime\" (O'Hara, 2018).Thus clearly showed Blair had much stronger attitudes to law and order. Traditional Labour looked at economical or sociological factors to determine the \"cause of the crime\" yet Blair refused to completely do this (New Statesman, 2015) .Blair was able to spend more money on policing, making the public aware to be cautious and prevent them from committing crimes. This way New Labour was able to make a significant impact on the level of crime committed resulting in a safer environment for everyone. <nl>Instead of solely focusing on the idea of equality there was now an idea of social justice that New Labour tried to achieve. New Labour introduced welfare-to-work schemes, tackled homelessness and also encouraged the numbers in early years education to increase (Poverty.ac.uk, n.d.).The \"coalition’s 'social justice' strategy\" was considered to help those who were disadvantaged because of their environment and upbringing. New Labour wanted to make sure that those who were in the lower or middle classes still could be as successful as those in the higher class. <nl><nl>What were the positive outcomes of New Labour? <nl>Blair made more investments other than only in the law and order sector. For instance in the education sector. Spending more money on children and the younger generation meant it would help them stay focused and not on the streets. Influencing them to do positive things that could shape their future but also one of the future societies they would later form. New Labour's \"number one priority\" was education as promised in the parties’ manifesto of 1997 (Heath et al., 2013). <nl>This was later proved when achievements were made. Their investing and prioritisation achieved results such as only \"one in twelve\" secondary schools were below the basic minimum standard. This was a big development in comparison to nearly half of all schools below standard in 1997 when New Labour acknowledged the area of needed development. <nl>Funding in the health department was also increased. An article writing about that period claims There was a \" huge injection of money\" into the NHS (The Guardian, 2007). This was a change because past tory governments did not spend that much. This meant there would be in decrease like waiting times at the A&amp;E but also better facilities to access. This brought the social group of those who were sick or disabled to create stronger support for the New Labour parties' reforms. <nl>Businesses and those interested in the market system were fond of New Labours' new policies revolving the market. New Labour had thought of the \"prawn cocktail offensive\" (Giddens, 2010). This was a strategy that influenced the support from those in the finance society. This type of market economics gave consumers much more freedom in making decisions that would impact their businesses in comparison to the previous government. Due to the fact, these groups were now given shared responsibility, they felt more a part of the nation rather than before where decisions were being made without their input. <nl><nl>What were the negative outcomes of the New Labour Party? <nl>Some argued that New Labour was just \" Thatcherism continued\" (Dorling, 2010). Critique Danny Dorling argued that New Labour did not achieve anything. Instead, Blair followed the same steps as Thatcher and this resulted in the income equalities to further rise instead of creating a difference that Blair had promised. The build-up to New Labour allowing more of the NHS to become private or the introduction to university tuition fees meant a result of wealth inequality. Again, only those with money in their pockets were given more opportunities and better services. <nl>Those who look at it from a 'Relational' perspective could argue that the nation was \"encouraged... to be ‘consumers’ of services rather than participants\" (IPPR (Institute for Public Policy Research), 2016). This means there is a possibility more public services were reformed into becoming privatized. Those’ participants’ who are not fortunate enough wouldn't be able to be consumers. Supporters of ‘old' Labour were not pleased by this \"privatization by stealth\" (Vidler and Clarke, 2005). Due to the fact it just carried on creating inequalities. <nl>State welfare was not a reform everyone was pleased with. In an article analysing \"social democratic values\" (Shaw, 2003).Writer Eric Shaw discusses the idea of \"poverty traps\". Are people benefiting from the state welfare if the amount of money given is provisional and only certain groups in society are benefiting from this? An article discussing poverty within the Labour party believes New Labour seems to be instead of using poverty traps as a means to \" justify its welfare reforms\" (Stepney, Lynch and Jordan, 1999). It holds its traditional value by allowing wealth to be distributed equally. However, it withholds the nation's full support by making the rich believe they are making the poor wealthier which makes them believe it is unfair. <nl>Some could argue that New Labour spent way too much money. New Labour made many promises in its manifestos to the nation so it had to try and achieve them. Their journey to handling \" social exclusion\" meant \"heavy. Investments (such as) £1.7 billion (was) spent on the New Deal for Communities\" Instead of solely focusing on the idea of equality there was now an idea of social justice that New Labour tried to achieve. New Labour introduced welfare-to-work schemes, tackled homelessness and also encouraged the numbers in early years education to increase (Poverty.ac.uk, n.d.).However, even after all this money, there was always more problems following the ones that were solved. For instance, the recovering support needed afterward for those who had a problem with drugs was not given. Therefore, not every single social group was fully satisfied. <nl><nl>Conclusion <nl>Unfortunately for some the New Labour party saw a rise and then a fall. Britain has not seen the Labour party return back to power since 2010. Instead, the conservatives have managed to win the elections and gain the interests of the public. In the upcoming 2019 December general elections Labour has been greatly promoted but as just as the ‘Labour Party’. Since 2015, when Jeremy Corbyn was appointed as Labour party leader he shifted Labour on the political scale back to the left from the centre (Bowie,2018). Due to the fact New Labour promoted its modernised values, there’s a possibility in the future Blairs Labour could be developed and improved to meet the needs of those who disapproved of the shift to the centre. However, New Labours' dramatic fall in history and negatives outcomes could discourage the public trust in such a party. Throughout this exploration of the transformation from 'Old' Labour to New Labour, you can see clearly that there are more differences than similarities. Blair tried to change the face of Labour huge but failed to make it work. This can be shown through how the negative outcome heavily outweighs the positives. To conclude, the transformation did make a big impact on British history however not a good one. Blair worked very hard to please the nation and achieve everything he promised yet it wasn't possible to satisfy everyone and also wrong decision led to negative outcomes that Labour will be remembered for.

{"id": "7cb2d07c-9c84-44e9-bb8d-67be349f2d45", "discourse_types": ["essay", "memo"], "pair": ["Immigration refers to ‘the process by which people come in to a foreign country to live’ (Cambridge Dictionary 2019). There are a range of political, social, and economic motivations behind migrating. The costs and benefits of immigration vary dependent upon the point of view from which they are being examined. According to the Office for National Statistics ‘migration is still adding to the population of the UK’ (Office for National Statistics 2018). In June 2018 ‘273,000 more people moved to the UK with the plan to stay for 12+ months’ (Office for National Statistics 2018) than left. <nl><nl>The Specific Factor Model can help us to understand further the impacts of immigration.<nl>The ‘variant of the Ricardian model’ (Iowa State University 2019) and was developed ‘to explain the migration of workers from the rural to urban areas after the Industrial Revolution in the 1820s’ (Iowa State University 2019). The model ‘allows for the existence of factors of production besides labour’ (Krugman, Obstfeld &amp; Melitz 2018). It recognises labour as ‘a mobile factor that can move between sectors’ but also that ‘other factors are assumed to specific’ and may only ‘be used in the production of particular goods’ (Krugman, Obstfeld &amp; Melitz 2018). The diagram below displays the effects of International Labour Mobility.<nl><figure><nl>The line MPL represents the marginal product of labour for the home country and MPL* the foreign country. Profit maximisation occurs when the value created by an additional unit of labour equals the cost of employing that unit. Microeconomic theory allows us to assume that MPL is equal to real wages. This assumes that a monetary value can be placed upon productivity. Initially, the number of workers employed in the home country (H) is represented by 0 to L1 and the number employed in the foreign country (F) is represented by 0* to L1. It is assumed that H is labour abundant relative to F and therefore incentives to migrate to find work exist. Wages levels in H start at W and in F at W*. Workers migrate from H to F and in the process of doing so alter wage rates and employment levels in each country, allowing an integrated equilibrium at point A to be achieved. The new equilibrium sees H employing 0 to L2 which is lower than the initial number. F now employs 0* to L2; higher than the original amount. Wages increase in H from W to W’ and fall in F from W* to W’. They have converged to the equal level of W’. Dependent upon the perspective from which this impact is being examined, this can be considered a cost or benefit of immigration. The home country sees the benefit of increased wage rates whereas the foreign country sees wages rates fall. This may have a negative impact upon the foreign country’s current workforce by lowering the incentive to participate in the labour force. A fall in wage rates may also cause adverse selection as workers with ‘certain unobservable characteristics are more likely to enter the market at the current market price’ (Sloman, Garratt &amp; Guest 2018). This means that workers with lower skill sets and productivity are the most incentivised to enter the workforce. Higher skilled workers may choose to not work as they feel the current market price undervalues their abilities. However, a study shows that an average inflow of immigrants equating to 1% of the UK-born population leads to just a 0.6% decline in wages for the lowest 5% of paid workers (Dustmann, Frattini and Preston 2008). This suggests that the negative impact upon wages resulting from immigration is minor and the other benefits may easily be seen to outweigh this. Finally, the area ABC represents the overall world output increase following migration. This shows that migration of workers benefits the global economy and allows a higher output level to be achieved.<nl><nl>One of the benefits to the UK of immigration is the provision of an increased labour force. In the year ending June 2018 ‘migration for work remained the most common reason’ (Office for National Statistics 2018) for moving to the UK. This is beneficial to the UK as it may help to fill skills gaps and resolve the continued productivity puzzle. The productivity puzzle refers to the ‘relatively weak’ UK ‘productivity growth since the late-2000’s recession’ (Office for Budget Responsibility 2012). The increased labour force raises competition for jobs incentivising workers to be more productive in order to secure work. It also allows companies to be more selective over who they employ enabling them to raise output. Furthermore, an increased labour force can raise aggregate demand, gross domestic product (GDP) and tax revenues. With more people in work the levels of disposable income in the economy is likely to increase and therefore have a positive impact upon the demand for goods and services causing an increase in consumption (Pettinger 2017). Higher employment also generates more tax revenues for the UK government due to more workers paying income tax. This can lead to increased government spending. A combination of increased levels of both consumption and government spending in the economy is likely to raise aggregate demand. Consequently, the aggregate demand curve shifts rightwards as displayed in the diagram below.<nl><figure><nl>The initial aggregate demand (AD) is represented by the curve AD1.  The curve shifts to AD2 and causes the level of real GDP to rise from Y1 to Y2. This increase in GDP as a result of higher demand has a positive impact on the economy. It is working towards the macroeconomic objective of ‘achieving economic growth’ and also implies improved ‘levels of economic welfare’ (Powell and Powell 2015). It shows an example of demand pull inflation; ‘a rising price level caused by an increase in aggregate demand’ (Powell and Powell 2016). The price level has risen from P1 to P2 causing inflation. Finally, immigration of working age people is beneficial towards improving the UK’s dependency ratio (Pettinger 2017). In 2016 the age dependency ratio was reported at around 56.17% of the working age population (Trading Economics 2016). The UK currently has an aging population and therefore ‘the old age dependency ratio (OADR) is increasing’ (Office for National Statistics 2017). This means that more tax revenues are required to continue paying out pensions and cover the care costs of more elderly people. The UK population alone is likely to struggle in maintaining these payments and therefore workers from abroad are beneficial as they provide more revenue for the government. On the other hand, there is the risk that immigrants may take up work in black markets to receive cash in hand payments and avoid paying taxes. Not only does this impact negatively upon government revenue but it also highlights the potential risk of increased crime rates due to immigration.<nl><nl>However, there are also potential costs to the UK of immigration. It ‘brings social and cultural pressures that need to be taken into account in planning for future services’(Embrace 2019) and may cause potential strains on the economy. Firstly, immigration poses potential complications with language barriers and cultural differences. There is the risk that immigrants may not have the language skills to meet job requirements and therefore may struggle to find or remain in work. This may require the provision of more education as immigrants seek courses to help improve language abilities. Courses are often funded by the government therefore increasing government expenditure. Furthermore, there may be strong differences in culture and this can result in ‘difficulties and friction with local people’ (Embrace 2019). Some locals may take the view that their culture is being destroyed by an influx of other cultures and this can impact negatively upon the integration of communities. Finally, the net increase to UK population resulting from immigration ‘can put pressure on public services’ (Embrace 2019) such as the NHS, education and housing system. For example ‘immigration contributes to financial pressure on the NHS’ (Dayan 2016). With the NHS already running a large deficit of £960 million at the end of the 201718 period (The Kings Fund 2018), any additional strain from immigration can only worsen the situation. There is also wide spread shortage of housing across the UK. Figures predict that around 300,000 more houses need to be built annually to try and combat the housing crisis (Mortgage Finance Gazette 2019). Again, with immigration adding to the population each year an extra strain is being placed on the housing system (Pettinger 2017). Furthermore, immigration can also impact negatively upon the UK welfare benefits system. Some immigrants may meet the criteria to receive certain welfare payments and this therefore increases government expenditure. At the end of the 2018 financial year, the UK’s budget deficit was reported at £1,763.8 billion; ‘equivalent to 85.8% of gross domestic product (GDP)’ (Office for National Statistics 2018). Additional payments to immigrants in the form of funding for education, housing, health care and welfare benefit payments may therefore add to this deficit causing further debt for the UK government. All extra expenditure focusing upon funding additional services for immigrants comes with an opportunity cost. The money could instead be used to fund a range of programmes aiming to improve long term supply factors such as productivity and human capital. It could be invested in UK businesses or used to fund tuition fees for UK students.<nl><nl>In conclusion, industrialisation and globalisation have aided immigration and its potential benefits to the world’s economy. It has enabled productivity and welfare improvements worldwide. For any economy, including the UK, there are a range of both costs and benefits of immigration. Whilst the UK’s immigration ‘figures have remained broadly stable since the end of 2016’(Office for National Statistics 2018) events such as BREXIT and increased protectionism by other nations may affect these in the future. The UK in general benefits from immigration by receiving a larger workforce and therefore greater tax revenues. The main costs to the UK results from the increased populations effect upon public services. As the UK is a developed economy, it receives a greater benefit from immigration of workers who can fill skills gaps and aid productivity.", "Hotel: Scandic Simonkenttä , located in the city centre, 131 euros per night, breakfast is included.

{"id": "a162ea44-553c-40a4-836e-7cb786095eac", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Assessing Attitudes Towards Zoos<nl>Introduction: <nl>This study’s hypothesis is that participant’s attitudes towards zoos would have a wide variation. This is because some participants may have a positive attitude due to their involvement in conserving species, and some a negative attitude due to animal captivity. Reade and Waran (1996) support this, stating that zoo visitors have positive perceptions of zoos whereas members of the general public have negative views. <nl><nl>Method:<nl>Positive and negative statements about zoos were pooled in which 10 of each were selected for the pilot study (Appendix 1), which recruited 10 participants. Negative statement scores were then reversed, so that negative attitudes equate to low scores, and vice versa. To assess the internal validity of the pilot questionnaire, each participant’s scores were totalled (see Appendix 3), and the 4 highest and lowest scored participants were selected. The 4s and 5s selected by positive and negative participants were compared to assess whether an item was discriminatory. Statements differing in scores between these participants fit into such criteria. 4 discriminatory positive and negative statements were selected for the main study (Appendix 2). The 10 original participants were recruited for this version, along with a further 10. The totals of each original participant were compared between the pilot and main study (Appendix 4) to assess the questionnaire’s reliability. Total scores of all participants were then calculated (Appendix 5). <nl><nl>Results:<nl>The internal validity test (Appendix 3) showed that 11 statements were discriminatory: 4 negative, and 7 positive. The lowest scores ranged from 41 to 45, while the highest ranged from 55 to 69. These participants reported either the most negative or positive attitudes respectively. Only two participants produced the same score when completing the pilot study and the main study (Appendix 4). A Spearman’s Rho test found that there was a significantly strong correlation between the test and re-test scores (rs = .838, p &lt; .01). 90% of participants scored higher in the pilot study compared to the main study. 3 of the 4 positive statements had standard deviations (SD) over 1 (Appendix 2), meaning that there was a wider variation of responses to these, whilst negative statements had SDs less than 1. The statement with the lowest SD was positive (SD = .489), whilst the highest was negative (SD = 1.268). As the hypothesis suggested, participants had a wide variation of scores (M = 22.4, SD = 4.297), ranging from 16 to 28 (Appendix 5). This SD indicates a large spread of data across the mean. <nl><nl>Conclusion:<nl>The results of Appendix 3 showed that there was high internal validity since the positive and negative statements differed in scores by participants, suggesting that the questionnaire measures what it was set out to measure. The Spearman’s Rho test showed that the questionnaire had high test-retest reliability as results from participants were similar in the pilot compared to the main study (Appendix 4). The larger SD of the final responses of the positive statements indicate that the results are widely spread across the mean, while the smaller SDs for the negative statements suggest that there was less of a variation in responses to these. Therefore, it can be concluded that participant’s attitudes towards zoos do not have a wide variation, as participant’s responses were polarised, with a smaller variance in responses with negative statements compared to positive.

{"id": "8e98fda9-7a03-461c-8fd0-8f21245568ae", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a concept that captures the obligation of a business to the environment, its stakeholders and the broader society (Blowfield, 2005). Over the years, the concept has evolved from corporate philanthropy (Bowen, 1953) to incorporate broader concerns such as environment and human rights, driven by social rights and legislative change (Carroll and Shabana, 2010). In recent years, CSR has been viewed as a link between business strategy and sustainable development, causing companies to utilise industry standards such as the United Nations Development Goals and Global Compact. This pressure from stakeholders to go beyond the minimal requirements allows companies to address broader goals and objectives, and by doing so, a positive brand image is created (Carroll, 2016).<nl>Political influence can be defined as a \"social influence process in which behaviour is strategically designed to maximise short-term or long-term self-interest, which is either consistent with, or at the expense of other’s interests\" (Ferris, Russ and Fandt, 1989). Political CSR is described as activities where \"CSR has an intended or unintended political impact, or where intended or unintended political impacts on CSR exist\". Therefore, political CSR can be used in three ways, which will be analysed further; these include being used as a substitute for non-conventional forms of political activity or directly supporting conventional political activities such as lobbying and constituency building. Additionally, CSR can be used in a novel or innovative way which does not directly correspond to political activity (Frynas and Stephens, 2014). This assignment will evaluate research surrounding the relationship between CSR and political activity, analysing the three ways CSR has been utilised to advance corporations political standing concerning real-life cases.<nl>The reasons in which CSR can be strategically used generally concerns initiatives to build corporate brand image or reputation, constituency building, building relationships and even agenda setting whereby donations can reinforce key industry messages to shift perceptions (Fooks and Gilmore, 2013). In order to analyse the relationship between CSR and political influence, this report will be focusing heavily on the research surrounding Coca-Cola, British American Tobacco and oil and gas companies. However, it must be noted that there is a limitation of the research surrounding the relationship between CSR and political influence, as it primarily focuses on these industries.<nl>Industries surrounding public health and the environment has been seen to invest heavily in CSR operations to \"offset\" their negative brand image and gain political support due to operations that are seen as working directly against society’s benefit (Fooks and Gilmore, 2013). For-profit corporations have been increasingly promoting that they act as partners with government and communities to address social problems. These partnerships are what Coca-Cola’s former CEO refers to as \"connected capitalism\", in which collaborations help maximise shareholder value (Foster, 2014). In turn, by utilising constituency building, corporations can facilitate access to policy elites and build relationships with them. This relates to a global triangle, an approach to sustainability in which business, government, and civil society join. Coca-Cola’s CEO claims the partnership system Coca-Cola has developed is \"the most beautiful example\" of the golden triangle where each party can come together and make a difference to big societal problems (Radtke, 2013).  Although CSR sees an increasingly political role for business firms, corporations are analysed to \"step in\" using \"a global triangle\" to fill governance gaps which they present as governments failing to do so alone. This positioning to take on political responsibilities is seen as a way to present themselves as pursuing public interests whilst pursuing their own political interests whilst building relationships (Eberlein, 2019).<nl>CSR as a means of Constituency Building and Facilitating Access to Policy Elites<nl>Ha and Hoang (2020) discovered a positive relationship between corporate social responsibility and political risk, suggesting that firms are more likely to invest in CSR as an \"insurance mechanism\" against adverse political events. Corporations can utilise CSR to support conventional political activities through constituency-building strategies to establish relationships with key opinion leaders, policymakers, media, and community involvement. In turn, this attempts to influence public policy by gaining the support of voters and citizens, who in turn express their preferences to political decision-makers (Mialon et al., 2016) (Hillman and Hitt, 1999). Although constituency building is a relatively robust strategy, Rehbein and Schuler (2013) argue that it is hard for companies to implement effectively. This is due to the difficulties convincing societal groups to politically participate, showing the support of a corporation. Even if stakeholders were to participate, it is hard to guarantee their effectiveness (Mialon et al., 2016).<nl>Neu et al. (1998) discussed that firms expanding their efforts to manage their legitimacy forestalls regulatory activities by the state that might occur without these efforts. Therefore, utilising CSR as a method of constituency building can minimise the political, legislative changes that can broadly impact businesses due to the legitimisation effect. For example, Mialon et al. discovered that Coca-Cola in Australia heavily used constituency building strategies by using CSR to have relationships with health organisations, community groups and policymakers. More specifically, Coca-Cola developed an initiative to encourage physical activity for kids called \"The Happiness Cycle\", partnering with an Australian charity. This was also interpreted as an agenda-settingframing activity as the company promoted the initiative to \"curb obesity\" and emphasised that they wished to be \"part of the solution\" (Mialon et al., 2016).<nl>By using their reputation and influence in a region gained by their CSR initiatives, companies such as Coca-Cola can wield power in governmental organisations. This was present in India, where two members of FSSAI (Food Safety Standards Authority India) are affiliated with an organisation funded by Coca-Cola. This organisation has undermined public health policies by networking with nutrition sciences to nudge \"government policy into alignment with the company’s corporate interests\" (Greenhalgh, 2019). By employing CSR through community campaigns, corporations can gain a sense of \"legitimacy\" that forms a sense of trust, increasing the likelihood that constituency building will be effective and increase their political influence. Furthermore, enhancing legitimacy enables corporations to conduct business activities more effectively than firms that do not engage in community CSR activities and may help minimise risks such as shareholder activism, boycotts of products and negative media coverage (Mirvis, Googins and Rochlin, 2007).<nl>However, Mialon et al.’s research surrounding the food industry's corporate political activity can be criticised because it could only incorporate publicly available information. This means that the research is unlikely to give a complete picture of the practices adopted by the food industry, as there is a lack of public documentation surrounding political activity, such as lobbying policymakers and private interactions. Therefore, this questions the validity of their findings, and the specific details of how CSR industry practices influence political activity needs to have further investigation.<nl>Exploiting CSR politically to work with other influential groups creates the perception that the message a corporation wishes to convey is balanced and credible, adding to the benefits of using CSR as a means of constituency building (Friedman et al., 1994). Using statistical analysis, Navarro (1998) concluded that although a company’s philanthropic activities can enhance brand image, increasing the effectiveness of lobbying activities, there was no direct relationship found between CSR activities and policy outcomes. As suggested previously, only firms working against public welfare will be using CSR to gain political influence, such as those within public health and energy industries. Therefore, as Navarro’s study incorporated a range of firms from different industries, it was unlikely to find a correlation between CSR and political outcomes. <nl>CSR can be strategically utilised to meet stakeholder needs and improve a company’s competitiveness and profitability (Porter and Kramer, 2006). CSR can be used to gain a positive brand image to attract more customers with the increasing demand from stakeholders for companies to adopt socially responsible practices to create a more sustainable and equitable world. Not all CSR initiatives are used to gain political influence, but the benefits of a positive brand image indirectly can help firms gain political power through Constituency and Relationship Building.<nl>CSR as a means of Agenda Setting<nl>As mentioned previously, CSR is also used as an Agenda Setting method to produce political effects. Fooks discovered a close connection between agenda-setting and constituency building where donations were allocated by BAT to groups \"based on their potential to shape policy agenda through their influence on government thinking and news reporting\" (Fooks and Gilmore, 2013). Smoking tobacco is the leading cause of death, illness and impoverishment, killing more than 8 million people each year (WHO, 2020). However, despite this significant public health crisis, tobacco companies and other unhealthy commodities utilise CSR as a PR initiative to create the illusion that they are a \"changed\" company and operate with health interests (WHO, 2009). Research by Fooks et al. analyses that Philip Morris and British-American Tobacco (BAT) engages in CSR primarily due to the potential to promote policy outcomes that work against public welfare. Specifically to prevent the introduction of effective government regulation, which has a record of effectiveness in reducing tobacco consumption (Fooks et al., 2012). Utilising CSR as an Agenda Setting method has allowed BAT to make donations towards reinforcing industry messages designed to alter the discussion of tobacco control away from public health and more towards the economic impacts and employment opportunities the industry gives.<nl>Agenda setting aims to manipulate public awareness surrounding issues prevalent in an industry that directly correlates to Coca-Cola. Hamilton (2015) discovered that Coca-Cola’s press releases surrounding CSR have a language that exhibits a paternalistic mentality with words like \"serve,\" \"help,\" and \"provide\". This paternalistic activism contends that outsiders are not best equipped to solve social and environmental issues, therefore boosting the image of their importance. The corporation exhibits a \"power-over\" approach that analysed as robbing communities of the \"decision-making process that affect their lives\" (Ledwith and Springett, 2010). It is hard for the general population to gain back their political influence from corporations acting in a CSR positive way when considering the substantial disparity between communities and Coca-Cola’s access to resources, political decision-makers, and media outlets (Hamilton, 2015). <nl>Additionally, in Georgia, USA, the Coca-Cola foundation pledged $3.8m to tackle obesity with the public health agency, the CDC (Radtke, 2013). The Times reported that the money given to the CDC contributed towards a strategy of funding scientists \"who encouraged the public to focus on exercise and worry less about how calories contribute to obesity\" (Kaplan, 2017). Utilising this charitable CSR initiative can take the narrative away from their unhealthy sugar-filled drinks contributing to obesity. By presenting themselves alongside their CSR projects using paternalistic vocabulary to the media, Coca Cola can shape the public agenda and shift perceptions of the underlying adverse effects of their operations and impact on public health. <nl>Gómez (2019) found that three primary factors can limit Coca-Cola’s agenda-setting influence, which is likely to impact other corporations. First, the ability of industry lobbyists to meet with legislative members; second, the pre-existing ties a government has with a corporation and the interests they have in benefiting from the companies’ operations and finally; the corporation supported researchers and activist’s vs the public health advocates, which are divided on opinions. All three of these limiting factors can have risk reduced by CSR initiatives surrounding constituency building, building relationships, agenda-setting and improving brand image.<nl>CSR as a means to support lobbying activities<nl>Regarding lobbying to change the narrative, it is a practice whereby a company or organisation aims to influence government leaders to create legislation that will benefit their industry somehow. The oil and gas industry has been reported as the 6th highest lobbying spender in the United States in 2020 (Duffin, 2021). It is common practice for oil and gas companies to engage in \"greenwashing\" to appear more environmentally responsible (Cherry and Sneirson, 2011). Nasiritousi (2017) wrote about oil and gas companies and how their input and attendance at climate change conventions is controversial as one of the most significant contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. However, they portray themselves as lobbyists against climate change and fund organisations which discredit climate science. These corporations spend countless amounts of money to change the narrative, such as campaigns that convince consumers that their lifestyles must change, as also seen with Coca Cola previously. Campaigns promote that humans are the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases- prevaricating the possibility that they are the largest polluters. Showing that they are \"reactive\" to these issues and rebranding themselves as part of the solution to the climate crisis helps to minimise the chances of a significant policy change being implemented that will further impact their business (Cherry and Sneirson, 2011).<nl>The oil and gas industry can be analysed using Goffman’s (1959) self-presentation theory whereby activities are analysed by a \"front-stage\" of how companies present themselves sustainably and the \"back-stage\" which relates to their corporate political activities. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) bill has been a considerable controversy for the oil industry. It was designed to allow oil investigations to occur in sensitive environmental areas (Cho et al., 2016). Environmentalists and Indigenous communities disputed the ANWR bill due to the irreparable impact oil companies would have on their land. Cho et al. (2016) analysed how oil firms sustainability and CSR practices pressed on the importance of environmental care, ensuring that their CSR practices were visible. However, they kept their proactive political actions targeted towards their interests of passing the bill \"back-stage\". This is a form of impression management whereby firms push CSR practices to an audience to be perceived favourably, and these elements are what the firms are getting more attention for. This method of emphasising positives and underplaying the negatives of their intentions is a common component of sustainability reports whereby corporations will seek to demonstrate how their activities are aligned with social expectations (Goffman 1959; Collinson 1999; Cho et al., 2016).<nl>Corporate Reputation and Image<nl>In addition, Chen et al. (2007) discuss how US companies with worse product and safety infringements were more likely to give to charity than those with better records. They analyse how CSR can be used as a \"distracting technique\" which is an innovative method of gaining political influence without directly operating politically. Their findings suggest that corporate philanthropy is used more for legitimisation than a measure of CSR performance. Companies can legitimise operations by utilising creative philanthropic activities by rebranding their image to reshape public imagination or ideology (Chen et al., 2007). <nl>For example, trans-national corporations (TNC) are known for exploiting the environment in emerging market economies more commonly than developed economies. This is because TNC’s are likely to utilise the cheap labour and abundance of resources available in emerging market economies and exploit these for profit-maximisation purposes (Khanna, Palepu and Sinha, 2005). In order to minimise political changes such as increased taxes, emission permits and caps on natural resource use, companies can employ CSR initiatives to regions to improve the country’s infrastructure and social programmes, presenting themselves as a positive contributor to the region (Hohnen and Potts, 2007)<nl>In 2000, Coca-Cola established a plant in Kerala, India, where their bottling plant drew around 510,000 litres of water from open wells and boreholes. Non-governmental organisations (NGO’s) discovered that water table levels have decreased from 12m to 35m below the groundwater level. Local women and children had to walk nearly 5km twice a day to fetch water, although it was often unsuitable for drinking and bathing as the water burned their eyes and led to numerous skin conditions (Raj and Shaji, 2017). Additionally, harvest dropped by 40% due to the lack of irrigation, and Coca-Cola allowed toxic wastewater to flow into farmers’ fields near the bottling plants (Foy and Senker, 2012). Coca Cola has been documented to have numerous unethical violations worldwide, such as human rights violations in Columbia and environmental violations in India. <nl>However, The Coca-Cola Foundation has donated over $1 billion in contributions to enhance local communities’ sustainability, focusing on areas such as water conservation and recycling, economic empowerment for women, providing education, youth development, and other community and civic initiatives (Coca-Cola, n.d.). These donations are vital to governments that do not have the financial means to provide these services themselves, therefore relying on TNC’s heavily, which increases the power corporations hold in these regions (Willem te Velde, 2002). By positioning themselves as intensely involved in water conservation and community products, unethical behaviour is more likely to be overlooked, and instead, stakeholders will focus on the positive efforts made (Johnston, Amaeshi, Adegbite and Osuji, 2019). So, by engaging in CSR practices, incorporating business initiatives that benefit society, Coca Cola can uphold its positive image as a family-focused brand whilst minimising chances of political penalties on operations.<nl>Although the theory of using CSR as a method of distraction which Chen et al. (2007) discusses, was a strongly developed argument that companies with worse environmental and product safety history were more likely to give to charity than those with better operational history had some limitations to consider. The research focused on the pattern of charitable donations as purely a distraction technique, ignoring the discussion on the other reasons and effects of the patterns of charitable giving such as political CSR. Despite this, the research mentioned above shows a pattern of CSR encouraging bad behaviour to more likely be overlooked and instead, stakeholders will focus on the positive efforts made (Johnston, Amaeshi, Adegbite and Osuji, 2019). So even though CSR can be used as a distracting technique per se, the charitable contributions produce a legitimisation effect, which can help with political activities such as lobbying, access to policy elites, and constituency building due to the increased positive brand image.<nl>Final Analysis to Conclude<nl>It is without a doubt that there is a strong relationship between corporate social responsibility and political influence from the research provided above. However, as expressed previously, different industries are likely to use political CSR in vastly alternative ways, leading this topic to be challenging to analyse. Most research surrounds public health and environmental corporations that produce negative externalities to society. Therefore, even though the research utilised shows the strengths in the relationship, it cannot be entirely reliable and applied to all industries.<nl>The research provided in this paper suggests that there is a relationship whereby CSR is used as an insurance mechanism against political risks, insinuating that corporations are likely to increase CSR activities when the political environment is uncertain. Without a doubt, industries working against the public’s welfare have benefitted from using CSR as a means to gain political influence, as seen with the oil and gas industries \"greenwashing\" activities, Coca-Cola’s constituency building and BAT’s donations to shape policy agenda. Additionally, improving brand image has been seen to help corporations legitimise operations to shape the views of the public and policy setters by forming a sense of trust.<nl>In order to identify the true relationship between corporate social responsibility and political influence, it would be necessary to expand research in a broader range of industries. The available research displays a pattern between increasing CSR practises when operational activities are not in the public interests. Therefore, it can be concluded that there is a strong relationship between CSR and political activities, at least in the industries concerning public health and energy, or involving questionable product safety. If this were applied to industries that do not primarily work against public welfare, there would be a weaker relationship between CSR and political influence.", "<addr6_NN>,<nl><nl>Apologies for the late response, I just wanted to say a massive thank you for helping me out.

I chose to look at ASOS because they are a company, I have personal experience as a customer with, as well as knowing other people who have shopped with them also. I also thought it would be interesting to look at a business that operates solely online as this is the future of a lot of commercial activity. <nl>DEFINE (Value Added Case) <nl>The CTQ trees (figure 1) detail what needs are important to me as a customer at ASOS. The needs I identified were; good customer service, quality products and a high-quality website. Good customer service is important to me as there is not a physical store whereby, I can interact with the staff face-to-face or be persuaded by the physical environment to continue returning. Therefore, I can say that the integrity of the brand to me as a customer is dependent to on how well its customer service performs. If an order is not processed correctly, I expect customer services to fix the problem in order for me to decide to purchase from them again. These needs are further established by the following quality drivers; time taken to receive my order and how quickly a response is provided to my enquiries. Again, since the transaction happens online, as a customer I deem the brand more trustworthy if I have a positive experience of my product or <nl>refund consistently received quickly, and communication isn’t slow. This is reassuring to me and suggests that they care about my experience as a customer. I would further break these quality drivers into measurable metrics seen in figure that uphold ASOS to a high standard. If these metrics are followed, ASOS should be able to successfully provide good customer service. <nl>MEASURE (SERVQUAL) <nl>I asked 5 customers to complete a SERVQUAL questionnaire regarding the RATER aspects of ASOS (Basu, 2000), including aspects of the service which are tangible (i.e. clothes and accessories) and intangible (i.e. delivery and refunds). The results of the questionnaire are represented in figure 2, which outline the gap between ASOS ’customer expectations and actual perceptions once they have experienced the service and products. According to my results the areas which ASOS need the most improvement are empathy and assurance as they both fall below customer’s expectations of an ‘excellent online retailer.’ However, the graph shows responsiveness to have low expectations (in comparison to other areas) as well as perceptions. This is significant as I identified responsiveness as quality driver in the CTQ diagram. Although, this also suggests an opportunity for ASOS to be competitive as customers do not have as high an expectation for online retailers to be very responsive based on their past experiences. If ASOS implement this in the next stages of their six-sigma process they may have found a way to increase their competitiveness. The results also highlighted that in both Tangibles and Reliability customer expectations were exceeded, therefore ASOS can be said to have a high-quality performance in these areas. <nl>MEASURE (Cause and Effect Case) <nl>After considering the results of the SERVQUAL questionnaire and the needs highlighted in the CTQ diagram. I have chosen to analyse the causes behind two areas; Slow responses, which was the lowest scoring activity on the questionnaire and a lack of range in sizes as I have friends who have had issues with this when shopping from online retailers such as ASOS. In the diagram (figure 3) I have thought of potential causes for these issues; in order to identify ways to fix the core problems and thus improve the customer experience. Of the causes that I have identified, the most important to me as a customer are the fact that staff are uncertain of how to respond to emails. This is significant because if staff are unsure of how to respond then my query may not get answered quickly or with a response that is unsatisfactory or doesn’t adress what I am asking. The other significant cause is ASOS being slow to re- <nl>stock. This is undesirable as ASOS are a fast fashion retailer, not being able to meet this expectation, defeats the purpose of their business model and would make me look to other retailers in the market. <nl>ANALYSE (5 Why’s and Affinity) <nl>In the next stage of my research I created a flowchart asking the question ‘why?’ five times to further analyse the issue and conclude a root cause. From this exercise and use of an affinity diagram (figure 5), I identified and was able to group that the root causes were management related. There were internal issues regarding staffing, recruitment, training and time management that could be the cause of difficulties in responding to customer quieres and being slow to re-stock orders. To summarise, ASOS, like other companies in the same industry, often experience high turnover and sometimes can be slow to recruit new people in efforts to try and improve their retention level. ASOS could recruit internally if staff training was prioritised, thus giving staff the confidence to take on management roles when they become newly available. Overall, these issues fall under the responsibility of the Human resources department. With this information I will begin generating some potential solutions to improve the efficiency of the human resources at ASOS. <nl>IMPROVE (6 Hats and 5 S’s) <nl>Following the previous analysis stages, I thought of some plausible solutions to the HR issues that are potentially affecting the level of customer service at ASOS. I adopted the six-hat tool to analyse my options. The best solution I thought of was to outsource training for the marketing staff, primarily those that deal with customer service; however, it is important that all staff in this department have the same training to support each other where short-staffed. The goal of outsourced training would be to instil the confidence of staff and introduce methods of working that improve efficiency, without placing burden on the management staff. Wearing the black hat, (the most powerful), highlighted that ASOS have to be financially able to undertake this and consider which budget this will come from. I also considered whether training would actually make a significant impact or not, using the green hat in response, I decided that specific staff could be asked to undertake the training, if they find the training successful then the training could be extended to more departments. The Six sigma principle ‘standardise’ can also be applied here by creating posters or handbooks that can be placed around the office as a quick guide to responding to frequent enquiries, leaving time to respond more carefully to more complex enquiries. Circling back to the green hat, a <nl>computer program could be internally developed that scans emails for key words, listing these as quick enquiries to respond to. Above all ASOS should make it a priority to highlight customer service excellence in their company statement to encourage staff internalising these values. \"To win in services, a firm must develop a passion for service quality within the entire workforce.\" (Foster S. Thomas, 2016) <nl>IMPROVE (PDCA) <nl>At this stage the PDCA tool (Basu, 2000) As mentioned in the previous stage, the solution to the lack of training problem would be to outsource training. Therefore, the pilot study would be testing whether outsourced training will improve the efficiency of staff so that they can respond to emails faster. This will be done by giving staff and management a questionnaire that details the task they are least efficient in before training and another after the training to measure improvement. If a significant improvement is seen (large difference between before and after training scores), more employees across the organisation could also undertake the training. One of the considerable risks with the study is the financial ability of ASOS to support the training. In this case, I have chosen this method because it is easily scalable and will not cost much in the beginning but affords all departments time to plan and budget for this opportunity. The RACI chart (figure 7) shows that there is a shared responsibility between the human resources and managers to communicate internally and the responsibility of the training agency to provide a good service. It is also important that human resources consult marketing managers about which staff should undergo the training and make sure that they are informed. There is also accountability on the part of the staff to gain as much as they can from the training as it is primarily for their benefit. <nl>IMPROVE (Process Mapping) <nl>Six sigma process mapping is an effective tool for documenting a series of necessary steps and display of the value stream so that each step can be analysed for value creation (Quality improvement tools, 2018). Documenting process maps before and after changes (figures 8 and 9) highlights where value was created for ASOS’ customer service team. In this case the value created is in the staff training although visually the difference is not vast it demonstrates the effects of training mentioned in the previous section. Staff before training were more likely to ask management and seek approval for their responses, delaying the time customers received an answer, resulting in unsatisfied customers who do not return. <nl>Recommendations <nl>Another useful recommendations I would offer to ASOS would be to continuously update their FAQ (frequently asked questions) section. After successfully dealing with a complex query, consider that this may be useful to other customers and will reduce the workload in the long run as more customers will consult this beforehand. When a clothing item is delivered, the return sheet could also direct them to this page also. The more ASOS can engage and provide help to customers the more that this need for good customer service (as mentioned in the define stage) is being fulfilled.", "lo,<nl><nl>I was able to read through the feedback however I wish to still go through the essay with you.<nl><nl>Thursday at 10 am works. <nl><nl>Thank you for your time<nl><nl>Kind regards, <nl><part_FN_SN><nl><new>Hello,<nl><nl>Thank you so much for your time and help that’s really helped me understand better.<nl><nl>Kind regards,<nl><part_FN_SN><nl><new>Hello,<nl>I was calculating my module credits and I think there has been an error. it appears that I am doing 4 modules on the <subject> side in comparison to the normal 3 that I'm meant to do. <nl>My credits should equal 120 however they equal 135. <nl> <nl>I wish to get this amended as I have been doing more than the average student.<nl> <nl>I wait to hear back as soon as possible so this error can be resolved. <nl> <nl>Kind regards, <nl><part_FN_SN>. <nl>(<student_number>)<new>Hello, <nl> <nl>Yes, I can confirm I did take <module> in TP1<new>Yes that is correct<new>Hello, <nl> <nl>I really wish to take that module, is it possible for me to remove a module that I have already taken under the circumstances that the system gave me too many modules ?<nl> <nl>Kind regards, <new>Hello, <nl><nl>I seek to get advice regarding my module selections. <nl>I take <course> and realised today that I was taking to many modules in TP1. the lady who deals with the module selections was made aware and removed an <subject> module from TP2 to balance it out.

The seafront is absolutely stunning so I think you'll enjoy it. The hotel has a restaurant that serves breakfast too. There's a National Museum of Finland that shows Finland's history starting right from the Stone Age, which is a 7 minutes drive from the hotel. The typical national dish is Sauteed Reindeer and the restaurant serving it or versions of it is called; Kaarna Baari &amp; Britto, which is about 6 minutes drive from the hotel. It specialises in local dishes. Kankurin Tupa is a gift shop where you can buy souvenirs for your children and it's about 7 minutes from the hotel. Finally, there's the Apollo live club that hosts events such as comedy and live music concerts (not opera), about 6 minutes drive from the hotel.

{"id": "d78ec6aa-50df-4387-8d7b-1db2d3062416", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Johns Case: <nl>John is an 18-year-old male university student living by himself, diagnosed with Atopic Dermatitis (AD) as a baby and Asthma at the age of 5 following a respiratory infection. He is prescribed preventer and reliever inhalers for his asthma. He is currently having respiratory issues such as wheezing, coughing and difficulty breathing which becomes more apparent during rugby. He reports trouble sleeping, anxiety and stress and feeling depressed, making studies become a struggle and he currently copes by distracting himself and is thinking about quitting university and moving back home. John experienced an asthma attack recently too which has led to his self-isolation behaviour due to feeling embarrassed. From my understanding his flareups in both conditions have become severe noted by the effect on his life, without control over his conditions his stress has turned chronic which signifies an impaired hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (Dhabhar, 2006; Guilliams &amp; Edwards, 2010).<nl><nl>Quality of life &amp; Mental Health: <nl>John’s quality of life (QOL) and mental health are intertwined, and they have both recently plummeted, every aspect of John’s daily life is affected. The association of asthmaAD and poor QOL is well notarised (Holm et al, 2006; Hossny et al, 2017; Miadich et al, 2015; Stucky et al,2015). Quality of life can be defined as ability to perform everyday activities and satisfaction with levels of functioning and control of diseaserelated symptoms with regards to physical, psychological and social well-being (Gotay &amp; Moore, 1992).<nl>Arguably the biggest QOL issue is his lack of sleep due to trouble breathing and itching symptoms from AD. Research has shown experiences of sleep disturbances are significantly associated with uncontrolled asthma and AD severity, exactly like john’s case (Jeon et al, 2017; Sundbom et al, 2018). Sleep is essential for energy and cognitive recovery, memory consolidation, muscle recovery and without sufficient sleep you are at a heightened risk of depressive disorders and even psychosis (Nutt et al, 2008; Walker, 2017; Waters et al, 2018). The lack of sleep may account for Johns experiences as he struggles with studies and he reports finding it difficult to look after himself by which we could infer to mean eating properly, basic hygiene andor managing his AD all of which would need the energy to do so.<nl>John’s decreased QOL can also be noted in rugby as he mentions he is out of breath quickly and his recent experience of an asthma attack; this follows trend with research as although exercise can be effective in asthma control and improving lung function this is only under circumstances of aerobic training not in the circumstance of rugbysports which can be actually asthma inducing like it is with John (Hansen et al, 2020; Kojima et al, 2009). Not only is John not enjoying it due to the troubles he is having, but it may be a contributing factor to his asthma getting worse. Although, the research for exercise induced asthma looked at children aged 6-14years which is a big gap in development to John. But the idea of induced asthma is supported by Del-Giacco et al (2015), who reports breathlessness a common occurrence in endurance sports like rugby and impairments are negated only when asthma is controlled, but John is not controlling his. We can infer from the research that John is playing rugby at a high intensity as low-moderate intensity can conversely reduce asthmatic inflammation (Hossny et al, 2017).<nl>As for mental health, John is experiencing an averse psychological state, he reports stress about university, living away from home and struggling to play rugby. Stress is naturally placed given his circumstances, research shows exam periods induce stress in asthmatic students, leading to increased inflammation via bronchoconstriction (Liu et al, 2002). Although this study had a small sample of only 20 participants, it is supported through literature like Kullowatz et al (2008),  who reports stress reduces lung function directly. Furthermore, Johns AD flareups are supplementary to additional stress in what is known as the itch-scratch cycle, AD can be triggeredenhanced due to corticotropin-releasing hormones and mast cells from stressing and likewise AD itself is then inducing flareups by altering the skin barrier making John feel more stressed (Arck &amp; Paus, 2006; Arndt et al, 2008).<nl><nl>John is affected by feelings of anxiousness and worry too, about his time management and exam performance. Exam anxiety is a common experience for many, and research has found 20-25% of college students experience it (Ergene, 2003; Thomas et al, 2017). However, that being said, John’s feelings of anxiety and worry are likely exacerbated given his conditions, research shows AD is likely to generate anxiety due to itching and perceived social stigmatisation (Chrostowska-Plak et al, 2012). Likewise, there are strong significant associations between asthma and anxiety disorderscurrent anxiety (Del-Giacco et al, 2016). Despite this, an issue in the latter study is that in half the cases anxiety preceded asthma, we cannot comment on whether Johns anxiety is caused by his asthma becoming severe nor on whether he has developed an anxiety disorder or if he is simply just feeling anxiousness currently. <nl>John is also experiencing depressive mood; this is highly predictive from intensity of daily stressors and research has found anxiety disorders have 20-40% co-morbidity overlap with depressive disorders (D’Angelo &amp; Wiekzbicki, 2003; Huppert, 2008). But likewise, with points above without standardised measurements we cannot say whether John meets the criteria for mood disorder diagnoses. Alongside these correlations, Johns conditions themselves are associated with low mooddepressive symptoms (Kim et al, 2015; Zielinksi et al, 2000) .The sample in the study for AD being especially noteworthy, having used matched control participants and finding significance whilst controlling for many lifestyle variables. In summation, both literature and the case study signal an issue of low, depressive mood.<nl><nl>Coping:<nl>John reports coping by suppressing thoughts and distracting himself with TV and videogames. Considering the perspective of the transactional model of stress and coping, it seems John on the contrary is not  actually ‘coping’ as noted by his reports of him stressing instead (Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1987). His behaviour itself is anxiety based and would be deemed mal-adaptive, he is directly avoiding his problems via distractions and doing so this may also play a part in further stress generation as noted by Holahan et al (2005). Not only is the avoidance increasing Johns difficulties but so is his attempt to suppress his thoughts, research shows that suppressing thoughts does change your expressive behaviour but does not affect your emotional experience (Cutuli, 2014). Johns attempt to cope only gets worse as in the case study it mentions him wanting to quit  university and move back home, this signifies a deeper plunge into avoidance.<nl>In theorising why John is primarily using avoidance and suppression, we can infer two things, that John believes he has no control over his situationconditions, as reported earlier John is actively isolating himself and needs social support. Humphreys et al (2011) found via focus groups that those with asthma, centralised coping on social support rather than controlling their symptoms, however john has moved out and does not have his mom to be his social support anymore and is self-isolating from friends. We infer he is dealing with feelings of helplessness as a result of not being able to cope his normal way. The idea of helplessness is not a new idea in johns’ case, a report on AD specifically found feelings of helplessness and also anxious-depressive mood which can be seen with John (Schut et al, 2014). <nl><nl>Interventions:<nl>The psychological path to solving Johns intricate case of mental and physical health issues cannot deny the invaluable significance of medication found for both asthma and AD (Atherton, 2003; Ram et al, 2001). Furthermore, even accounting the sheer variance of psychological therapies, psychology has come up with limited evidence to treat physical symptoms of asthma and  has  little to no ability in changing medication adherence as noted by meta analyses, psychology as a standalone will be ineffective to treat Johns physical symptoms from asthma (Nieuwlaat et al, 2014;Smith &amp; Jones, 2015). However, for AD there is significant findings of the effect of psychology therapy such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) on severity, itching intensity and scratching (Chida et al, 2007).<nl>Albeit the best recommendation is for a multidisciplinary approach to Johns case supported by research in asthma-related hospital admissions and management of AD (Burke et al, 2016; LeBovidge et al, 2016). Whereby John receives 5-9 1hourweekly CBT sessions for his anxiety, stress, and AD from us, research has found significant improvements in asthma specific QOL, stress and depression (Parry et al, 2012; Grover et al, 2007). Furthermore, given improvements in all those dimensions we can expect anxiety to reduce in correlation <nl>The other parts of the multidisciplinary team could support him via social care for isolation and medication via allergygp services. Lastly, it may also be informative for John to be told about options of digital SMS interventions for example where he would receive a text to remind him to take his preventer inhaler, found to improve medication adherence (Chan et al, 2018).", "lo, <nl><nl> <nl><nl>I Paid for the <course> Course and would like to drop the module now.

{"id": "e98ef79e-1144-476e-adb3-7b5f15144069", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Background Information<nl><nl>Kenya Airways celebrated 43 years of operations in January 2020. However, according to passengers who have recently flown with Kenya Airways, the airline is performing poorly and not meeting customer expectations. Standards have decreased and the quality of the overall experience has worsened. Based on the quantitative and qualitative data gathered, this is evident. There have been many occurrences of lost luggage, poor customer service within the airport and on the aircraft, and insufficient in-flight entertainment. This report will address these complaints using the quantitative and qualitative data collected and analysed to make comparisons with and provide sufficient recommendations for improvement.<nl>Quantitative Research<nl><nl><nl>Secondary data, \"data previously collected for some purpose other than the problem at hand.\" (Malhotra, Nunan and Birks, 2017) was gathered for a 5-year period (2016 - 2020 inclusive). The data was then logged into an Excel spreadsheet, where the customer name, gender, travel month and year, cabin type i.e. economy, route i.e. international, origin and destination were provided along with the overall rating of the experience and individual rating of each characteristic. The sampling technique used was stratified sampling: \"…a two-step process to partition the population into strata. Elements are selected from each stratum randomly.\" (Malhotra, Birks and Willis, 2013). Customers’ reviews were picked based on the year but at random. This technique was also chosen due to its increased precision and the need to include important information i.e. all eight individual ratings completed. Customers who had not completed all eight reviews were ignored during the selection procedure as all eight reviews had to be completed to enable graphs to be drawn and comparisons and conclusions to be made. <nl><nl>The question that rises from the data collected is: \"does gender influence the ratings of airline services?\" The two sample groups are male and female. A grouping variable t-test was carried out to work out the significance (appendix 2b). Since we have two groups, we want to compare the mean of ‘Array 1’ represented by males and ‘Array 2’ represented by females. As it is not known which gender scored a higher average rating, a two-tailed test using equal variances (2) needs to be carried out. Our results show a significance of 0.56 (to 2 d.p.), which indicates that it is not statistically significant. The significance value is more than 0.05 (p&gt;0.05) and the t-value is less than 1.96 (t&lt;1.96) which proves the results are not significant. Therefore, there is no difference in one gender rating services higher than the other, and there is no expectation that the differences will be replicated in other samples. <nl><nl>To support this further, the airline characteristics ratings were split by gender, where the number of males were 50 and the number of females were 28. A table of the average individual ratings and standard deviation were recorded (appendix 2a) and a graph to represent the averages was drawn as shown on the next page.<nl><figure><nl>From the graph, it is evident that females gave lower ratings compared to males (except for ‘in-flight entertainment’, where males rated it an average of 3.10 and females rated it 3.18). The biggest difference in ratings was for ‘legroom’ with a difference of 0.33. The standard deviation for males and females is close to 1 meaning that the data points are clustered closely around the mean and there is a normal distribution. Therefore, it supports our hypothesis test of there not being a significant difference. An overall average airline rating was calculated and plotted in a graph as shown below. <nl><figure><nl>The graph shows that the most poorly rated characteristic was the ‘in-flight entertainment’ with a rating of 3.06. With all individual ratings being around 3, the overall rating can be assumed as an average of 3. We can compare these results with the overview of the official rating of the airline displayed on the TripAdvisor website (appendix 1b). The link for the website page is indicated by appendix 1c. The results are similar to the TripAdvisor ratings meaning the data collected is representative of the population. The standard deviation was also calculated for comparison and recorded in a table along with the averages (appendix 1a). From the table, it is evident that the standard deviation is close to 1 meaning that the data points are clustered closely around the mean and that there is a normal distribution.<nl><nl>To understand whether each characteristic has improved from 2016-2020, a table of averages was created (appendix 3). The table shows the total average for each year declining, where the best year was 2016 (average of 3.77) and the worst year was 2020 (average of 2.91) – the graph indicates this. A line graph was drawn to represent this information (below).<nl><nl><figure><nl>The biggest decline was from 2019 to 2020, with a difference of 0.44. However, there was an improvement in the customer service from 2018-2019 with a rise of 0.57. In the year 2017, ‘cleanliness’ had the highest average (3.92) compared to the rest of the years. Again, this proves that quality of services has been declining. Therefore, the overall quality of characteristics has worsened.<nl>Qualitative Research<nl><nl>To further support the quantitative analysis, secondary qualitative research was carried out. This was done by randomly selecting 25 customer reviews from the years 2016-2020 (5 for each year). All 25 reviews were analysed, and a coding frame (appendix 4a) was written up to categorise the factors further. For example, check-in and boarding was broken down into flights, luggage, and other. This was to understand in detail what the reviews highlighted.<nl><nl>Appendix 4b indicates an example of an analysed positive review that includes characteristics such as value for money, check-in and boarding, seat comfort, food and beverage, and in-flight entertainment. For example, the customer (travel year 2020) commented on the ‘seats being very comfortable’. The average rating for seat comfort in 2020 was 3.10. Although there was a very minor decrease (0.05) from 2019, it can be assumed the seat comfort is steady and quality is not changing drastically. <nl><nl>However, throughout the 5-year period, customer service was the most frequently complained about (airline staff and cabin crew) with a total of 12 negative complaints each. Airline staff includes staff who are not directly involved in the airport or aircraft, but are still part of Kenya Airways staff i.e. headquarters, call centres etc. The majority of complaints relating to airline staff were about staff being unfriendly, impolite, and incompetent. Some reviews mentioned that staff need to be trained as there was no sense of empathy. On the other hand, there was 1 positive review which mentioned the service being on a ‘high level’. Cabin crew also had 12 negative reviews, mostly about the staff not caring about errors made as well as not apologising. On the other hand, there were 9 positive reviews, making the total -3. This tells us that although there are positive customer service reviews, there are more negative ones meaning that customer service is worsening over the years. This can be also be proved by the graph shown by appendix 3 where the customer service rating fell from 2016 (4.00) to 2020 (2.90). This indicates greater confidence in customer service declining as there are frequent reviews to support this.<nl><nl>Appendix 4c shows a negative review written by a customer in 2016. The review mentions customer service (airport staff and cabin crew) and food and beverage (qualityportion). Again, customer service was poor due to staff not caring or apologising. Furthermore, the airline had run out of vegetarian meals and no drinks were offered either. The coding frame shows the total for ‘qualityportion’ as -3, indicating that the airline is performing poorly in this service. Appendix 1a highlights that ‘food and beverage’ is the second lowest characteristic rated by customers with an average of 3.25. This supports the coding frame.<nl>On the other hand, there are three characteristics where the airline is performing well – legroom, seat comfort, and food and beverage – taste. The total scores based on the coding frame are 2, 3, and 2 respectively. Legroom had 2 positive reviews, both commenting on spaciousness, seat comfort had 4 positive reviews, and food and beverage – taste, had 4 positive reviews commenting on good and fresh taste. However, there were also negative reviews for seat comfort, where seats were not as comfortable and the taste of food not being great. Overall, Kenya Airways are doing well in these areas of service. Appendix 1a shows this for ‘legroom’ as it has the second highest average rating of 3.60, which supports the qualitative research and indicates greater confidence since reviews are consistent hence representative.<nl><nl>Whilst appendix 4b has a positive review based on flying business class, other customers travelling in business class had negative experiences, based on poor customer service, rude staff and lost luggage. Therefore, this demonstrates inconsistency of the airline as customers are receiving different treatment even when demographics are the same. Rather, customers in business class are having the same issues as those travelling in economy, which raises the question as to whether Kenya Airways view all customers as equivalent despite paying extra for better service. Moreover, staff are lacking in training which leads to poor service regardless of whichever cabin customers are flying in.<nl>Recommendations<nl><nl>Kenya Airways are performing at an average level (3.0) in comparison to competitors such as Qatar Airways (4.0) (Qatar Airways Reviews and Flights - Tripadvisor, 2020) and Emirates (4.0) (Emirates Reviews and Flights - Tripadvisor, 2020). While Kenya Airways are scoring close to an average rating of 4.0 in characteristics such as ‘cleanliness’ (3.71) and ‘legroom’ (3.60), they are scoring low in characteristics such as ‘in-flight entertainment’ (3.06) and ‘food and beverage’ (3.25) while receiving frequent complaints about services such as ‘check-in and boarding’ and ‘customer service’. Therefore, in order to excel, regain customer confidence and outperform competitors, many improvements need to be made throughout the airline. <nl><nl>Firstly, improvements need to be made in customer service, mainly the airport staff and cabin crew. According to reviews on TripAdvisor, the cabin crew have a lack of care and are impolite towards passengers. As suggested by customers and to avoid future negative interactions with passengers, training needs to take place frequently e.g. every 4-6 months to ensure staff members are able to handle situations with care, show understanding and remain polite. Once training is complete, staff should be tested by answering scenario questions. Those who score less than 70% should undergo further training. The process can be repeated until they score 70% or over. Customers who feel comfortable and at ease are more likely to have a positive flight experience, resulting in greater positive reviews and higher ratings. Moreover, airport staff are being criticised of showing attitude and being unhelpful. Again, training needs to take place to avoid future negative experiences. A similar assessment as the cabin crew can be carried out with questions aimed more specifically for airport staff.<nl><nl>Secondly, the in-flight entertainment needs to be improved. Passengers have complained about the equipment being broken and the movie list not being up to date. This can be quite frustrating especially when flying for long hours as there is no sufficient entertainment available to use. The first course of action should be for the movie listing to be updated (as mentioned in one review) on all aeroplanes and provide a wider array of entertainment as Emirates do (appendix 5). This will keep passengers entertained for the length of the flight. To avoid faulty equipment, all equipment should be checked before passengers aboard the plane.<nl><nl>Finally, the portion and overall quality of food needs to be improved. There have been a number of complains written by customers who mention the portion size of food is little and sometimes drinks are not offered either. This can be seen as unacceptable, especially for those flying in businessfirst class as complimentary drinks are mandatory and passengers are paying extra (value for money). Portions need to increase as a result, by up to 25% to satisfy expectations and drinks need to be offered with every meal, as well as in between.", "<nl><nl> <nl><nl>I'm not sure whom I should be contacting about this issue so I'm emailing yourselves and hopefully you are able to guide me through or direct me to whom I need to contact.<nl><nl> <nl><nl>I'm filling in the application form for re-enrolment however I'm not sure what to put down for funding since my placement is unpaid.

This is an interesting topic to explore because me personally and people around me, have experience of studying Psychology and being a part of Korean society and the Japanese and Manga Society at Aston university. Most of the members of Korean society are Psychology undergraduates so I found that quite interesting and wanted to see if there was an actual link between these types of university students and an interest in East Asian culture as many of them join related societies such as the ones mentioned previously or martial arts societies from these specific cultures to develop their interests or to find new hobbies and interests out of curiosity.<nl><nl>My main research question is ‘What Psychology students’ experiences are in being interested in Korean culture?’ I decided this would be an Interpretative phenomenological study as it focuses on student’s personal experiences and reasonings behind why they chose to study Psychology and why and how they became interested in Korean culture. Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) focuses on \"wanting to understand the meaning of human experience\" this suggests that the method is focused on trying to understand and make sense of how people make sense of their experiences. IPA is also an idiographic form of research method as it is \"conducted at the level of the individual case\" so you’re able to \"make specific claims about the individuals studied\" (Sullivan, C. &amp; Forrester, M.,2019). This means that it is more person orientated and allows researchers to look at certain niche groups and create specialised generalisations on specific typesgroups of people. Therefore, I felt like it was a method that was most suited to this topic as the group of people I am studying are quite specific.<nl><nl>I approached the analysis by highlighting points of interest whilst transcribing the audio of my semi-structured interview. After completing the transcription, I went through my highlighted areas and did descriptive summaries on them. I then tried to group the coding to come up with relevant theories and see if anything was contradictory or could be explained further.<nl><nl>Analysis<nl>The key themes I will be discussing in this analysis are relatability and self-discovery, as they constantly came up throughout the interview which allowed me to group multiple parts of discussion into these two themes.<nl><nl>Relatability <nl>I chose relatability as one of the themes because during the interview, my participant Faith (Fake name) mentioned a lot of situations where she felt she could relate to them through her personal experiences. Faith mentioned that true crime, especially rape cases was one of the reasons she became interested in Psychology as it touched her. Being South African, Faith felt like she could relate to the issue of citizens going through the constant threat of gender-based violence against women. A study conducted found that gender inequality was part of the reason why women were more likely to be murdered by an intimate partner or contract HIVAIDS from them. The researchers found and concluded that women with violent and controlling male partners (abusive) were more likely to contract the viruses as those men would force their partners to take part in risky sexual practices (Dunkle et al, 2004). Faith mentioned that prostitution was also illegal in South Africa and again, due to the gender disparities, female sex workers are criminalised, and systems aren’t set in place to protect them from harm. Faith wants to \"help in positive change, treating people like people instead of (.) dehumanising like. [they’ve been though a lot]\". This further supports the claim that sex workers are not treated fairly and due to their nature of work and even based on just their gender, are not protected but even blamed.<nl><nl>Faith feels that Korean culture is respectful, and group orientated, she states that \"with the whole <nl>South Korean culture like they are all like respectful to each other it’s a culturist culturistic culture so <nl>like I really enjoy that\". From this we can infer that Faith is drawn to the group orientated mindset, <nl>however, I am assuming that when she means ‘culturistic’ she meant collectivist, I did check it by her <nl>to be sure. She feels like South Korean social culture is like South African culture in terms of mutual <nl>respect for the people around you and the collectivism shown amongst people, she mentions that \"I <nl>love working together\" and \"in South Africa you know your neighbours, you know everyone, here <nl>you don’t [know your neighbours] you don’t know your flatmates\" this suggests that she can relate <nl>to Korean culture more than Western culture as they share similar cross-cultural values that she <nl>understands, thus supporting the effect of relatability on her interest in South Korean culture.<nl><nl>Self-discovery<nl>I chose self-discovery as another theme because whilst talking to Faith, I was able to find out that she felt personal connections to some experiences she discussed and felt that they brought out or revitalised parts of her interests or personalities that were previously doormat or overshadowed. <nl>Faith stated that Psychology was her favourite subject during sixth form, and it was the only one she found interesting during A levels \"A levels was like the worst two years of my life\" this suggests that A levels was not an enjoyable time for Faith and further shows how Psychology could have been her favourite subject. She also highlights how her Psychology teacher during that time was really kind and helpful to her \"he helped me like prepare everything to do for uni\" she says now, she does not regret her decision to study Psychology at University all these things combined may have influenced the positive feelings she started to have when first learning Psychology which has led her to pursue it at a higher level.<nl><nl>Faith finds that she is learning more about herself through Psychology even though she believes that \"Psychology involves learning about others\" this suggests that Psychology allows for the personal development of students who study it and gives a chance for them to open their minds and find out about other things that may interest them.<nl><nl>Within the theme of self-discovery, as Faith became more interested in Korean culture, she also became interested in Korean skin care \"South Korea has the best skin care\" this just coincides with the common sentiment of Korean skincare. The country is known worldwide as the plastic surgery capital and for its dermatological research and highly popularised cosmetic culture which includes skin-care routines, this has led to the sale of high quality, mostly affordable products targeted for the skin on the global market (find research stats &amp; qoute). Due to the increased interest in Korean culture, this has also increased accessibility to these things and many media outlets such as Korean music and media, this as a whole, is known as the ‘Hallyu wave’. Faith also expresses her interests in music and media, specifically K-pop, she expressed that she really enjoyed dancing to K-pop groups songs as she was not able to during secondary school, Korean culture \"has brought back like dancing part of me back\" this suggests that exploring the culture further has allowed her to pursue her interests again. <nl>Faith has also taken an interest in Korean food and feels like the country’s cooking practices have entered her cooking style \"like now I’m starting to cook with like Soy sauce [and all these things]\" this shows how influenced Faith has become by Korean culture and how its seamlessly interwoven into her life. She states that \"everything I do now just leads me to them\", the ‘them’ being the main interest points of Korean culture for her e.g., dance and cooking. <nl>Faith also found interest in Korean dramas and movies due to recommendations from friends but was <nl>already interested in other foreign shows \"(.) I just got bored of watching Western stuff\" this suggests <nl>Faith’s willingness to consume media and entertainment different to watch she usually consumes, <nl>indicating an open, which was one of the reasons I expressed for the connection of Psychology <nl>students and their interest in Korean culture as Psychology students usually cultivate an open mind <nl>during their degrees.<nl><nl>Through this analysis of the themes, I have been able to conclude that there is a link between <nl>Psychology students’ experiences with interests in Korean culture whilst focusing on Faith and what  <nl>her experiences are. The link is related to the benefits of open mindedness which allows you to find <nl>new interests pr develop old ones that you previously had, especially open mindedness to cultures <nl>different or similar to your own but in another societal setting.", " <addr12_FN>,<nl><nl> <nl><nl>Please find attached the participation information sheet and the consent form.

{"id": "c7ed83d7-2b14-4bf0-80db-201eb638d4e8", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Police interviewing with eyewitnesses and victims has always been subject to scrutiny by psychologists and legal professionals. Over the past years, there has been significant psychological research in this area, with various new techniques being introduced and implemented in police training to ensure testimonies of eyewitnesses, victims, and suspects to be as accurate as possible. While these techniques can be applied to both eyewitnesses and suspects, victims of crime need particular care and consideration when being interviewed about the crime. One example of such victims are sexual assault victims. Studies have shown that only 16-20% of rape victims report the crime to the police or other legal justice systems (Kilpatrick et al.,1992). There are many reasons for such a low rate of reports; victims are likely to have PTSD (Karatas et al., 2020), they may be worried about confidentiality during interviews, both of which tie in with the belief that there’s a lack of training in police training when conducting interviews with sexual assault victims (Rich and Seffrin, 2012). This essay considers these factors and proposes two recommendations that the police should consider when interviewing sexual assault victims; 1) rapport building (Holmberg, 2004; Collins et al., 2002) and 2) the combination of the Cognitive Interview (Fisher and Geiselman, 1992) and an WRIP approach (Heydon and Powell, 2016).<nl><nl>A potential factor to consider when interviewing sexual assault victims is the method of  interviewing. A survey study has shown that among 429 police officers in the USA, many of them were not sufficiently skilled in conducting interviews with victims of sexual assault (Rich and Seffrin, 2012).  Such lack of training negatively impacts the volume of sexual assault reports the justice system receives. Therefore, it is important to implement a technique that addresses this issue of lack of training and in turn, encourages more victims to come forward and report sexual assault incidents. <nl>A key element of any police interview is rapport building. Rapport building is a type of effective communication skill (Vallano et al, 2015) that is characterised by establishing a positive and comfortable relationship and atmosphere between the interviewer and interviewee (Vallano and Campo, 2011). There are multiple ways in which a police interviewer can establish rapport with a sexual assault victim; addressing the victim by their name, active listening, adopting open body language (matching and mirroring the interviewee’s body language (Boe, 2009)), and maintaining frequent eye contact (St-Yves, 2006). Indeed, Holmberg (1994) (as cited in Holmberg, 2004) found that when rapport was used in an interview with a rape victim, the victim was more willing to narrate about the crime event as she claimed the interviewer encouraged her to describe the events in \"such an intimate way\" and felt he was doing it for \"her sake\" and not because it was \"for the investigation\". Moreover, Keats (1993) also found that when the technique of rapport-building was used in interviews, both the interviewer and interviewee were comfortable and appeared to freely discuss the events of the incident all while the interviewee demonstrated willingness to co-operate with the investigation.<nl><nl>Another advantage of rapport building is that it seems to elicit more correctly recalled information and more detailed information (Pinizzotto &amp; Davis, 1996; Collins et al., 2002). Therefore, not only does this technique increase willingness in victims to come forward and report sexual assault crimes, but it also increases the quality and quantity of information recalled by interviewees, an aspect that has always been a drawback of investigative interviewing.<nl>However, as with any recommendation, there are a few limitations to consider. While the notion of rapport-building is commonly known in the legal justice system and highly recommended by researchers and practitioners (Abbe and Brandon, 2013), it is important to note that the definition of rapport-building is not clear-cut, that is, much of the literature surrounding this technique includes a variety of definitions. While some researchers claim rapport-building involves creating a positive and friendly relationship with the interviewee (Collins et al., 2002; Hartwig et al., 2005; Vallano and Compo, 2011), others argue that it is defined as a neutral, working relationship between the two parties (Abbe and Brandon, 2013). With such conflicting definitions, it is hard for police interviewers to gauge a comprehensive understanding of rapport-building and hence may result in them not using the technique to its full potential.<nl>Nevertheless, a questionnaire study conducted on 221 police interviewers in the UK revealed that police officers reported using rapport 87% of the time during their investigations with witnesses (Dando et al., 2008). This suggests that despite the contradicting definitions of rapport-building, police officers are still seeing the value in the technique and as a result, are implementing it in their interviews. Therefore, rapport-building is a valuable and effective technique that should be administered during interviews with sexual assault victims.<nl><nl>Another key reason as to why many sexual assault victims do not come forward and seek help from the legal justice system is because many of them experience PTSD. Around two thirds of women were reported to have features of PTSD (Karatas et al., 2020). This may lead to victims being scared to come forward as they believe that the police would not be trained to efficiently deal with their trauma and fail to understand them. <nl>An example of police interviewing technique that the police are required to use in their investigative interviews is the Cognitive Interview (Fisher and Geiselman, 1992). As well as the 4 main stages of the interview – mental reinstatement of context, reporting from a different perspective, reverse order reporting and in-depth reporting – the interview, more importantly, involves an introduction and a ‘transfer control’ phase (Geiselman and Fisher, 2014). During the introduction, the interviewer asks the interviewee simple questions, attempting to build rapport. In the ‘transfer control’ phase, the interviewer informs the interviewee that they are the expert since they were at the scene themselves. These two steps are crucial in that they enable the interviewee to have a more favourable experience of the interview (Fisher and Geiselman, 2010), meaning their satisfaction levels of police services are likely to increase. These satisfaction levels, in turn, are linked to reduced levels of PTSD type symptoms (Kunst et al., 2013) in interviewees who have experienced traumatising events, such as sexual assault. <nl><nl>While the Cognitive Interview has many benefits and has been found to improve total and correct recall more so than the standard interview (Gwyer and Clifford, 1997), there are problems with its practical application. One problem is that police officers believe the interview is very time consuming and takes longer to conduct than a standard interview and thus, cannot conduct the full interview (Kebbell et al., 1999). Another issue is that it requires significant levels of concentration and cognitive demands on the police interviewer (Fisher and Geiselman, 1992; Kebbell et al, 1999). <nl>Therefore, with these limitations in mind, Heydon and Powell (2016) propose a possible technique that could be introduced to police interview training, as an addition to the traditional interviewing techniques, known as written-response interview protocol (WRIP). This approach involves anonymous and confidential written reporting options for sexual assault victims commonly before a traditional interview. An example of a WRIP approach could be that victims of sexual assault write their story in their own time – whenever they feel ready – with prompts and guidelines designed to focus their writing on key points as well as maximise their recall. This written format can then be followed up with a formal interview. In terms of anonymous reporting, a WRIP that aims to achieve this should include instructions that are consistent with the Cognitive Interview techniques. For instance, a WRIP for confidential reporting must begin with an ‘Engage and Explain’ phase that includes the Cognitive Interview’s ‘report everything’ phase. While still remaining anonymous, it is important to still engage with the interviewee, to show sensitivity to them. Thus, it is evident that this approach allows police interviewers to have a lot of flexibility when interviewing sexual assault victims. <nl><nl>With the WRIP approach, many of the Cognitive Interview limitations are addressed. By allowing victims to record their experiences themselves as soon as possible after the crime, the police interviewers can use those initial reports for reference during the face-to-face interview phase, reducing the cognitive demands imposed on them by the interview technique and reducing the time it takes to conduct a full interview. Furthermore, by incorporating these two techniques together, the victims’ satisfaction levels, rapport building, and the quality of their testimonies are not compromised, rather they are further encouraged. However, it is vital to note that there has been no further research on the combination of these two techniques and their validity in real life situations. Nevertheless, theoretically, this collaboration appears to be the ‘Golden Standard’ and ‘fool-proof’ in the context of investigative interviewing. Therefore, with such considerations in mind, the combinations of these techniques should be considered as a practice for gathering evidence from sexual assault victims.<nl><nl>In conclusion, interviewing sexual assault victims is tricky. Regardless of age, gender, size, etc. reflecting and talking about such traumatic events is not easy for any individual. It is possible that it is because of this sensitivity of the topic that many victims are reluctant to come forward and report the crimes done to them. Nevertheless, it is the legal justice system’s responsibility that they have such measures in place that allow the victims to feel even a little bit of comfort when coming forward. It is the police’s responsibility to ensure the victims feel as if they made the right choice by reporting the crime. Considering some of the factors that might prevent victims from coming forward, this essay proposes two main recommendations that the police could potentially introduce in their practice. Both of these recommendations have a key thing in common – building rapport. Thus, it can be concluded that in any type of investigative interviewing, building rapport is the most important aspect.", "<addr3_FN>,<nl><nl>Sorry for the huge misunderstanding concerning accepting your changes.

Use examples to explain. <nl><nl>Deductive reasoning involves logical thinking, providing us with the means to determine valid arguments in one’s train of thought. Similarly, inductive reasoning is a way of increasing semantic information through generalisation, allowing us to come to conclusions about whether a statement is true or false. <nl><nl>Deductive reasoning is similar to inductive reasoning in that concrete or previously known knowledge affects performance on experimental tasks measuring components of ordinary language. For example, in deductive reasoning, our own beliefs effect the validity of conclusions we make because our world knowledge clouds our judgement. Wilkins, (1928) found participants’ beliefs caused conflict with the validity of syllogisms and as a result, their judgement was poorer. Beliefs effect the interpretation of premises, influencing reasoning and bringing about response bias, therefore affecting the validity of the conclusion made. Similarly, experiments on inductive reasoning show familiar content can remind a person of similar problems they solved in the past. Griggs &amp; Cox, (1982) called this the ‘Memory Cueing Hypothesis’ – individuals retrieve similar contexts or situations involving solving a similar problem from their long-term memory, reducing facilitation effects involved in reasoning. <nl><nl>Another distinction between these types of reasoning is the certainty involved in making conclusions. In inductive reasoning, there is no certainty that the conclusion made from premises are valid all the time, as validity of conclusions depends on factors such as premises given, intention of the argument or statement, as well as the amount of information available at the time. Contrastingly, deductive reasoning is not dependent on as many variables, and is much more clear-cut and direct. Deductive reasoning allows us to form completely valid conclusions all the time, due to logical systems this type of reasoning follows, such as formulisation. Therefore, the conclusion will follow from the premises with absolute certainty, unlike inductive reasoning.<nl><nl>2. Why do we find Wason’s selection task so difficult? <nl>Peter Wason’s selection task is a logic puzzle involving deductive reasoning, heavily influenced by Popper’s hypotheticodeductive method. Participants are presented with four cards and a simple rule, and are asked which cards they need to turn over to see if the rule has been broken. Performance in this task is only 15%, even if participants are asked to falsify the rule, not prove it right. Research suggests concrete content facilitates performance. Cheng &amp; Holyoak (1985) state that humans reason with context-dependent ‘pragmatic reasoning schemas’, involving knowledge about permissions, obligations and causations. These schemas function to predict and reason in unfamiliar situations. During the selection task, permission schemas are evoked along with a set of rules with familiar information in a given scenario. The corresponding schema matches information required to solve the task, and so permission schema facilitate performance, especially when concrete rather than abstract content is used. <nl><nl>Additionally, Wason’s selection task is found difficult when rules cannot be interpreted as a social contract. Cosmides, (1989) found the selection task is facilitated when involving social exchanges derived from his computational theory, specifically tasks requiring the participant to detect a ‘cheater’ trying to take the benefit without paying the cost of a contract. In the context of the selection task, the participant is detecting a ‘if P not Q’ card is exposing the cheat. Cheat detection is parallel with familiar realistic situations involving social interaction rather than ambiguous and context-free content. When a selection task uses abstract terms not involving social exchanges, participants find it harder to reason as the situation is unfamiliar and doesn’t entail benefits or losses. This highlights the importance of context in Wason’s selection task – when context is not given, performance decreases considerably.<nl><nl>3. What are the predictions of \"Subjective Expected Utility\" theory for human decision making. How have deviations been explained? <nl><nl>Subjective expected utility theory (SEU), (von Neumann and Morgenstern, 1944 &amp; Savage, 1954) describes decision making, stating when individuals make decisions, they will act rationally by trying to maximise their expected utility. SEU aims to simplify decision making via 5 axioms (completeness, transitivity, continuity, independence and ranking), which when considered, will maximise expected utility. <nl><nl>The transitivity axiom assumes people make choices transitively – if they prefer A to B and B to C, they should prefer A to C. Tversky, (1969) identified a deviation in this axiom, called ‘intransitivity of preferences’, stating that humans are, in reality, inconsistent in their preferences of choices due to individual differences in evaluative processes and because preferences vary temporally. Tversky conducted experiments using classic transitive preference scenarios and found participants’ preference ordering was inconsistent to the transitivity axiom. Classic scenarios are not logically compatible with the rationality of human decision making, because variability and individuality of decision making in realistic situations aren’t taken into consideration.<nl><nl>The independence axiom states preference of order between two choices with equal outcomes should not be affected by one another, even when a third gamble is involved. In other words, equal outcomes should cancel each-other out. A deviation in this axiom called the ‘Allais paradox’ (Allais, 1953), states the independence axiom fails to consider feelings like disappointment, as well as the rationality involved in choosing a gamble and potentially getting nothing from it. The Allais paradox states evaluations of gambles cannot be done independently of other gambles, as the independence axiom assumes. <nl><nl>These deviations highlight the importance for a newer theory to recognise the influence of rationality, and which involves a psychologically descriptive approach, for example the ‘multi-attribute utility theory’ which is more able to explain decision making in realistic scenarios where decisions are dependent on many independent variables.<nl><nl>4. Using a specific puzzle or problem of your own choice, write out a plan (including diagram) of how to solve it using a state-action tree. <nl><nl>This problem is the ‘Chicken River Crossing Puzzle’: A man has to get a fox, a chicken, and a sack of corn across a river. He has a rowboat, and it can only carry him and one other thing. If the fox and the chicken are left together, the fox will eat the chicken. If the chicken and the corn are left together, the chicken will eat the corn. The task is to find out how the man gets all 3 things to the other side of the river in one piece. <nl><nl>The solution to this puzzle is as follows: first, the chicken crosses the river in the boat, and the fox and corn are safe together on the other side. He goes back across, and then takes the fox across the river replacing it with the chicken, which is now on the other side. Since the chicken and corn cannot be left together, he takes the corn in his boat and switches the chicken for the corn, which he takes across and leaves it with the fox. He then returns to pick up the chicken and heads across the river one last time, where all his items are across the river safely.<nl><figure><nl><nl>5. What is \"creativity\" and how can it be assessed?  <nl><nl>Creativity is defined as one’s ability to generate innovative ideas and solutions, and is seen as a form of intelligence. Creative solutions are seen as valuable and insightful, often solutions that novice individuals may not have come up with themselves; in this regard, creative individuals are seen as experts in their domain, as they hold extensive knowledge giving them the ability to produce innovative and original solutions commonly acknowledged by wider society. <nl><nl>Various perspectives aim to assess creativity differently, for example the psychometric approach aims to objectively measure creativity. Creativity has been conceptualised as a form of divergent thinking by Guilford, (1956), which is a style of thinking that can lead to many possible solutions to the same problem. It requires both originality and flexibility. Psychometric tests of creativity include the ‘Unusual Uses Task’ by Guilford, (1967): the participant’s task is to create alternative uses for a common object. Four dimensions are used to score answers: flexibility, originality, fluency, elaboration. Participant’s demonstrate divergent thinking if they generate unusual yet valuable uses for the object. The ‘Remote Associates Test’ (RAT) was created by Mednick, (1962), who theorised that creativity involves associating nonidentical concepts which are considered dissimilar. In RATs, respondents are shown stimuli in the form of three words and are asked to identify a word to link them together, for example \"worm  shelf  end\". Here, the answer is book (book worm, book shelf, book end). Psychometric tests in assessing creativity have produced interesting results, especially the observed link between creativity and intelligence, however these methods often mix creativity and intelligence, or originality and creativity. That is, creative individuals tend to have high IQ, but not all high IQ individuals are creative, consequently decreasing the validity of psychometric tests claiming to assess creativity.", " degree in <subject><new><subject> is dea <new>d<new>All about <subject>😏<new>Wet ate upi <new>Wya??<new>are you even drunk <new>ffs<new>rah <new>Try go on now<new>Naaahhh<new>it’s not<new>wo<new>Idk I hat to do<new>Morning <addr2_FN><new>yh was rough lmaoo I’m okay now tho<new>she’s okay tho <new>No one wants help when tryna be sick <new>Okay good<new>lol <new>Poor <pers_FN><new>lmao the effects <new>Lmao they’re right <new>Let's (House)party.<new>no do it no<new>A<new>W<new>whilst everyone’s on <new>ew<new>omg it looks so empty <new>I’ve still gotta move out <new>oh hair <new>shit<new>Who was it<new>Was she blonde <new>Yh is our neighout <new>How much was he slamming it "]}

{"id": "a3666ef8-37a2-49cb-9b60-415df00b5b61", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Rationale:<nl>The research topic I am looking at links to the use of social media and what the possible consequences are, I chose to study this topic due to the wide use of social media and how much it has taken over what we do and how we live our lives. Social media is used in many ways such as for business purposes, marketing, cultural exchanges, news sources, etc. Most people in today’s society have access to at least a minimum of one social media platform due to the increased popularity in social networking, especially in the younger generation, but my research aims to look at how this may affect an individual. According to a survey conducted in 2018 by common sense media, 40% of teenagers aged between 13-17 claimed that keeping in contact with friends on social media daily is either \"extremely\" or \"very\" important. The main research question I am looking at is what is the impact of social media on an individual’s self-perception and relationship? This will be done by conducting a semi-structured interview, with the interview schedule being in the appendices, showing the development built from the main question. This includes the effects of social media for friendships relationships and families, how mental health can be damaged and looking at whether social media is seen as healthy or not. The method of analysis I have chosen for this research topic is discourse analysis, this is the most appropriate method, for the study I am conducting, as I am investigating the perception of social media and getting a better understanding at the individual’s views of social media rather than their life experiences. The name of the participant I interviewed will not be used to protect confidentiality, so I used the pseudonym Eliza. <nl><nl>Results:<nl><nl>Discourse 1- negativity of social media<nl>Eliza understands how much social media is used and how it does cause problems despite her lack of use of social media \"I rarely use social media\". Eliza portrays the discursive object as social media and the discourse of social media being negative. Eliza knows that social media is constantly being used and that people on social media may behave inappropriately leading to serious consequences. She understands the effects it can have on a person and the reason why people may behave this way. <nl><nl><data_extract><nl> <nl>Eliza realises that on social media people can act in a way that is not the same as how they behave in real life, but their actions can ultimately hurt the people they love. She explores that people use social media in the wrong way knowing that what they are doing is wrong however some people also get treated bad on social media for no reason and this can affect an individual due to increase of negativity. <nl><nl><data_extract><nl><nl>Eliza points out that not only does negativity affect communication between people but also interferes with how an individual feels about themselves, particularly through cyber-bullying which can destroy how someone might feel about themselves and make them feel low, therefore affecting how they behave. <nl><nl>Discourse 2- vital for families<nl>Eliza does share the good things of social media being that it helps keep people in connection with each other, mainly with families. Despite the risk of suffering bullying or negativity, some people may just use social media just as a form of contact to those they cannot get a reach of often or see in person.<nl><nl><data_extract><nl><nl>Eliza explains how social media is very beneficial to socialise for the right reasons to the right people, this is a common reason for Eliza using social media herself, to be able to interact with family and keep a strong bond from members of her family she might not see very often. This shows that although social media might not be a safe place, it does have positives for bringing people together and can in some ways create a stronger community amongst people. <nl><nl><data_extract><nl><nl>Eliza then goes on to discuss how social media can be a disadvantage with family members who might not allow freedom whilst on social media and watch over what they are doing, causing dispute between people. This is obviously seen as a disadvantage as people in the younger generation especially do not want to be supervised on what they do and who they talk to by relatives however, in other ways this can be seen as a good thing as by having family members on social media, this should stop people from posting something that may be inappropriate or offensive as parents can watch what their children are doing online. Eliza then goes on to talk about reputation and states \"oh, wait and also you might post things that goes against families\", this can vary between posting something that can go against religion, can be a hateful comment such as homophobia or a revealing picture that parents would not want other people seeing. This would therefore cause strains and arguments between family members as parents may try and be controlling but children may want some space for themselves. <nl><nl>Discourse 3- loneliness <nl>Eliza shared her thoughts on whether people who use social media tend to be lonely or not. She explained that is it common for people to use social media for company and may even talk to someone that they have not met before in real life. <nl><nl><data_extract><nl><nl>She claims that people do talk to people on social media due to lack in confidence in making friends which is becoming a problem for children as they might start to rely on talking to people online and causing them to lack the right skills to communicate with people in real life. She also mentions that people do it to make themselves feel better and more appreciated by having someone talk to them in a friendly manner. This goes against the points of being cyber-bullied showing that some people who might get bullied in real life rely on people on the internet to keep then happy. Eliza did suggest that not everyone uses social media due to feeling lonely but might use it because they could potentially be bored or still require more attention and people to talk to. Some people do have enough friends and families in their lives to talk to often but might get bored and want to use social media rather than actually feeling lonely.<nl><nl>Discourse 4- social media not healthy<nl>Eliza justified that social media can be healthy in some ways but may also be unhealthy and gave her views for both sides leading a balanced answer. She claimed that a lot of people use social media just for attention and to get people to start to notice them more which also makes them feel better and improve their self-esteem but in the wrong ways<nl><nl><data_extract><nl><nl>Eliza goes on to contradict herself by then saying it is healthy as individuals could use social media to seek help and people will reply to them in a way that makes them feel better. Some people find it easier to talk on social media and if that is their way of making themselves happier than it is being used in a healthy manner. Eliza basically claims that it is the mindset we have for using social media, some people use it to be needy and have people feel sorry for them and that is not a healthy way of using social media however Eliza thinks that letting out your problems is healthy when people do it to genuinely speak their mind and helps them to feel relieved.<nl><nl>Discussion:<nl>Eliza showed moments throughout the interview where she is against the use of social media and does not agree with how it is being used these days however, she also realises the importance of it. Through experience she realised that talking to family through social media is a great phenomenon which makes her feel content, she also brought on the fact that people who may need more support use social media widely to gain that support so can make people feel better. A study done in 2003 by Janet Morahan-Martin shows that individuals that are lonelier tend to use social media more for companionship and intimacy especially compared to those who are not so much lonely.<nl>Eliza shows the different people on social media who can either improve the well-being of an individual or make it worse depending on the type of person who uses social media. Some people care about individuals and do feel sincere about those who are troubled, and then some people feel joy about intimidating others through social media and have no guilt to tear apart friendships or relationships making social media an unsafe place. With the final discourse about whether social media is healthy or not, Eliza managed to show both points of views on whether it is accepted and beneficial or whether there are consequences, she stated it should only be used for the purposes of seeking help from anyone online and to relieve whatever pain, sadness or emotion they are feeling. The wrong way to do it is by lying or exaggerating on social media just to acquire a specific response or reaction from the people reading it.", "whom it may concern<nl><nl> <nl><nl>With the maintenance that will be taking place will it be stopped during the exam period because I and many other students will not be satisfied with construction taking place while we should be studying or doing an exam in our rooms especially since we have no other place to go to.

{"id": "78377a54-b1f0-4040-bab4-2c3d424d7f7f", "discourse_types": ["essay", "text_message"], "pair": ["This essay will establish that the greatest achievement of the EU is peacekeeping and war prevention and that European integration across several areas is integral to ensuring peace. Economic, cultural and legal integration will be examined to evaluate their impact on the overall success of the European Union, drawing on citizens' opinion, empirical evidence of success and criticisms of each area. However, it will finally conclude that peace across the continent is facilitated by cultural integration. Whilst economic integration prevents declarations of war, it is the individual citizens, brought together through cultural integration that allows for a closer union. Whilst co-dependence and economic reliance upon other nations prevents the declaration of war due to shared economic and monetary policies, which was established by the creation of the European Coal and Steel community in 1951. Ultimately, cultural integration reduces opposition to further economic and legal integration across EU members as they grow closer to the idea of a ‘European identity’. This will further be proven by the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the European Union, of which a large proportion of the factors that contributed to the result are cultural. Drawing a comparison with other regional organisations and their failures highlights the success of the EU project, particularly with its peacekeeping efforts, and will ultimately conclude that cultural integration is more important to peace and security than economic integration in today’s European society. <nl><nl>Economic integration began with the Treaty of Paris, signed in 1951 to merge economic ties of 6 European countries to create the ECSC. The objective of this treaty was to prevent the outbreak of war by the nations becoming economically interdependent with one another (McCormick, 2015). The ‘Schuman plan’ did aim to spillover the concepts of the ECSC to all other aspects of the economy. This ECSC evolved to become the EEC, after the Treaty of Rome was signed in 1957, with the effects coming into force in January the following year. The objective was to allow free movement of goods, services, capital and people; the main motivation was to ‘avoid any return to national protectionism’ (Bulmer et al, 2017). Despite the creation of a single market resulting in uneven benefits and disadvantages for each member, all six countries believed their economies would be better off in such a community, even if there were disproportionalities. Stagflation in the 1970’s limited the growth of the EEC, and by the mid-80’s a new plan for the future of the union was set out by Delors in response to the global economic climate. The white papers set a deadline of 1992 for the measures outlined to be enacted in each member state. The measures heavily referred to as ‘the 4 freedoms’; capital, services, goods and labour, achieved by removing physical, fiscal and technical barriers to movement between inter-EU borders. <nl><nl>With the history of economic integration outlined above, the advantages must be evaluated in order to answer the question. Benefits of a single market include the following; reduced production costs, lower prices for consumers, transfer of knowledge and skills, trade creation and co-operation on common projects by pooling skills, labour, knowledge and materials. These benefits ultimately mean that EU citizens have greater job opportunities, less expensive goods, and in some cases more advanced technology due the pooling of knowledge and materials. <nl><nl>Further integration across the European union progressed with the creation of the Eurozone. The Economic and Monetary Union became an objective in 1969, coming to fruition in 1999, with the introduction of the Euro currency. The single currency creates benefits for its citizens in that it provides more economic stability, lower costs as currency would no longer need to be converted and a stronger presence in the global economy. The introduction of the currency undoubtedly brings the union closer together, however there are a number of disadvantages of adopting a single currency. The largest being that monetary policy that covers a large, diverse area consisting of a number of nations, does not always fit local economic conditions. Economic conditions consider unemployment rates and inflation rates, standard Keynesian economic policy involves the increase or decrease of interest rates in order to prevent economic crash or to stimulate the economy. Connected to this issue, we will reflect on the Eurozone crisis of 2009 and evaluate to what extent the implementation of the single currency is successful. <nl><nl>Problems associated with a single currency are that it limits fiscal policy, and interest rates set are not optimal for every area. Both of these problems contributed in some way to the Eurozone crisis. According to Wijffelaars and Loman, the two causes of the eurozone crisis were the lack of effective mechanisms andor institutions to prevent the build-up of macro-economic institutions to effectively absorb shocks (Wijffelaars and Loman, 2015). However, in balance, the introduction of the euro promotes trade and encourages investment and has ultimately furthered economic integration across the European Union. In addition, according to Risse, the introduction of a physical currency shared with multiple nations across the union acts as a symbol of integration. The daily use of euro notes and coins reinforces the idea of a European identity (Risse, cited in Bulmer et al, 2017). <nl><nl>To elaborate further on the concept of ‘European identity’, this section of the essay will now focus on the impact of cultural integration in maintaining peace across Europe. Firstly, one must discuss the relationship between national identities and European identities. According to Ultan, the 2 identities have a close relationship. Whilst national identity is the most important and strongest, it is possible to have multiple identities, such as European (Ultan, 2016). By adopting a ‘European identity’, citizens can move slightly further away from nationalism (an important goal of the entire European integration project), and will be more likely to align themselves with EU policies and not just their own national policies (Ultan, 2016). The integration process for each country differs depending on the states’ traditions and cultures, but the same goal of assimilation to European culture is a fundamental objective to increase support for EU membership. <nl><nl>The Treaty of Rome signed in 1957 had no mention of culture or any form of cultural integration (Ultan, 2016), it was only with the signing of the Maastricht treaty in 1992 that this area of integration was considered and first mentioned. The Maastricht treaty set out the concept of European Citizenship, which grants rights to citizens of each member state including consular protection and freedom to live, work, and travel freely in other member states. According to the Eurobarometer survey conducted by the European commission, which surveys the opinion of 33,000 European citizens across all member states, shows that 68% feel that ‘they are a citizen of the EU’ (Stone, 2017). With the majority of the population identifying as a European citizen, it is clear to suggest that this area of integration has been successful. The ability for citizens of EU member states to move across borders to work, travel and live freely not only gives one a feeling of citizenship but also that the different nations are together as one. According to the European Commission, the freedom of movement is regarded by the majority of EU citizens as the greatest achievement of European integration (European Commission, 2019). <nl><nl>Ultan also identifies several important factors that are responsible for the success of cultural integration in Europe. The shared history, common religion and geography all have a direct impact on the integration process as they aid to create an identity that those across Europe can relate to. In his paper, Ultan also suggests that across Europe, citizens are ‘bound by their diversity’ (Ultan, 2016) and that in the creation of a European identity there should be respect for the fact there are a wide range of cultures, traditions and languages. This is reflected in article 6 of the Amsterdam Treaty, ‘ The Union shall respect the national identities of its Member States’. As Ultan suggests, promoting individual member states' cultural diversity results in respect for other nation’s culture (Ultan, 2016). Ultimately, this brings the union closer by means of respect and acceptance. <nl><nl>To further argue the importance of an established European identity, the example of Brexit can be drawn upon to suggest that the member state must recognise being European is a wider extension of their national identity; and not two separate identities which are at war with one another. It must be noted that the UK has always had difficulty aligning themselves with the rest of Europe, beginning with the reluctance to join what was then the ECSC, but eventually joining in 1973. The idea that the UK views Europe as the ‘other’ naturally creates Euroscepticism, which has been prevalent in the UK for decades; and became popularised during the leave campaign in 2016 (Murray Stewart Leith et al, 2019). According to the Eurobarometer survey, the (now previous) member state which views their national identity as exclusive was the UK, meaning that the majority of the UK’s population were unable to identify as European and suggesting that the national identity and the European identity are in conflict. With the result of the 2016 EU referendum in mind, one can assume that the idea of a European identity is fundamental for maintaining support for the union. Murray Stewart Leith et al suggest that the reason for ‘lukewarm feelings’ of Britons towards the EU is due to the fact that there has not been a national circumstance where joining the EU seemed necessary to solve the issue; unlike in a number of other EU member states (Murray Stewart Leith et al, 2019). For example. Germany’s desire to join the EU was to create a more integrated Europe and to reconstruct it’s national identity after the second world war, and Italy wanting a more stable political structure which the EU could offer (Murray Stewart Leith et al, 2019). The lack of European identity directly correlates with the lack of support for EU membership, and whilst this can be considered a major factor in the outcome of the referendum, the EU is not concerned that this feeling is spreading across the continent. The Eurobarameter survey conducted after the result in 2017 shows the support of citizens for the EU is actually at an all time high. It could be perhaps suggested, that Brexit has made the EU and the feeling of being European stronger for the remaining member states. <nl><nl>Further integration is necessary for maintaining a strong union and preserving peace, by increasing areas of integration and promoting the notion of a European identity, the EU can ensure its success in peacekeeping. The increase of integration across several areas can be explained by the neofunctionalist theory. This theory presents the argument that when one area is integrated, further pressure by actors can be exerted in other areas- causing a ‘spillover effect’. It’s relevance in theorizing the EU has diminished since the 1980’s, but does however explain the transition from the ECSC to the EEC. The debate surrounding integration theories for the EU are still ongoing, but many do stress the importance of supranational institutions in furthering European integration. <nl><nl>An area of integration, whilst not the most important to preserving peace by maintaining stability, but certainly an area that provides means of which other areas of integration can occur, is legal integration. The European Court of Justice upholds European law introduced by other institutions of the union. The ECJ acts as a supranational institution, and has jurisdiction in all member states, ruling on interpretation of the treaties. According to Garrett, governments largely accept the rulings of the ECJ, and the ECJ as a strategic rational actor rules taking into account anticipated reactions of the governments (Garrett, 1995). Understanding why institutions like the ECJ are important to integration across the European union can be thought of ‘integration through law’, intertwining European law into national law bounds all its citizens by common rule. Whilst each member state can implement its own national laws, it must enforce the laws introduced by the EU. According to Augenstein, ‘the legal system posits or presents the identity of the political community’ (Augenstein, 2012), thus inferring that the enforcement of law across all member states builds a sense of community and reinforces the idea of a European identity. <nl><nl>The aforementioned successes of areas of integration speak for themselves in that they are great achievements not only for each member nation’s economies, but for every single European citizen at an individual level. The unique success of the EU project shines its achievements across all areas of integration. However, in order to address the question, this essay will now focus on why peacekeeping is the single greatest achievement. <nl><nl>By comparing the EU and its peacekeeping efforts with that of regional organizations in the Middle East, the achievements of integration and peacekeeping in Europe can be highlighted and clearly identified. The Arab League and the Gulf Cooperation Council, created in 1945 and 1981 respectively, are two regional organisations in the Middle East established with similar aims as those of Schuman when the ECSC was created in Europe. The aim was to begin economic integration amongst the member states, and to mediate any regional conflicts without foreign assistance. Largely, both these organisations have been unsuccessful. According to Pinfari, the Gulf cooperation council ‘systematically failed to mediate effectively in major conflicts in the Gulf’ (Pinfari, 2009). Pinfari concluded his analysis of the success and failures of the Arab league and GCC by saying that claiming the entire project as a failure is ‘ungenerous’, yet the organisations do not have effective control on conflict resolution (Pinfari, 2009). It can also be argued that the Arab states have an inability to sacrifice their state sovereignty to a regional pool, whereas this has been done in Europe and ultimately allows the union to be successful. It could perhaps be argued that instability in the region can be largely blamed by the volatile and complicated history of the Middle East, however the continent of Europe has also had its fair share of historical violent conflicts. The success of the institutions created to maintain a strong bond between member states is especially highlighted when contrasted with the Arab league. The strongest evidence of success being that the EU was honoured by the Nobel committee in 2012 for ‘over six decades contributed to the advancement of peace and reconciliation, democracy and human rights in Europe’ (The Nobel Peace Prize 2012, 2020). <nl><nl>To conclude, the single greatest achievement of the European Union is peacekeeping between member states, but this has only been preserved due to strong economic and cultural integration. Both areas of integration are fundamental to peacekeeping; economic integration forms ties between states at the governmental level, but cultural integration forms the ties (and builds support for the union) at an individual level. Support for the evergrowing union must come from the individual citizens of each state, not just the governments. This was proven with Brexit, where the lack of European identity amongst its citizens resulted in a vote to leave the union, despite the government’s support for membership. This is why the EU project has been so successful, because each citizen benefits from the EU, not only economically, but also in that they have the right to travel, work and live across the continent. By providing citizens with several benefits, the support for the union increases. One would argue that cultural integration is more important to ensuring peace as not only does it prevent opposition for further economic integration but it also creates the idea of a single European identity. So to answer the question, economic integration is not the EU’s greatest achievement; but that is not to say it is not important or extremely beneficial to member state governments and European citizens. Whilst economic integration was the primary goal when the ECSC was created, today the union requires deeper integration in order to survive and preserve peace. The conclusion that the single greatest accomplishment of the EU project is peacekeeping derives from the simple fact that since the establishment of the ECSC, which has evolved to become the EU we know today, there has not been a continental outbreak of war, and peace between EU member states has been maintained. The aims set out by the Schuman plan have been fulfilled as Europe has not been involved in any intercontinental war, breaking a cycle of continuous conflict since the 16th century (Ette, 2016).", "ww Ma’sha’Allah 💕💕💕<new>I look so scary wth<new>But time fliessss mannn<new>Miss youuuu🥺♥️♥️<new>Omgg noo wayyyy<new>Finally man we haven’t met in like a yearrrr<new>Yesss just come next week? <day> the buses are running now aswell<new>Let me know as soon as u do!<new>Yess and <pers_FN_SN> aswell comeon<new>😂😂<new>What month do is she going<new>Omg really end of <month> ?<new>It better b before we come back😂<new>Omg ur ganna come to hers aswell<new>So u need proper clothes n accessorise<new>Yesss omg can’t wait<new>Yeah they’re ganna b sik days<new>I’m ganna b so bored when u go"]}

{"id": "0196f363-ac72-46c0-8748-23b855e943eb", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Introduction<nl>The non-binary gender movement is seen as a relatively new phenomenon due to increased activism in the years 2015 and 2016 (Richards, Bouman, &amp; Barker, 2017). Campaigning for awareness and inclusion by organisations such as the Non-Binary Inclusion Project has brought the conversation into mainstream society, however there is a longer supressed history. Consequently, there is very limited literature regarding non-binary individuals and the social attitudes towards them. Day and Nicholls’ (2019) produced a paper exploring attitudes of non-transgender students towards transgender people which induced interest in the presented research topic. As history has progressed, society has shown to become more accepting of people and ideas that lay outside the norm. However, statistics by YouGov show that 41% of trans people and 31% of non-binary people have experienced a hate crime in the last 12 months (YouGov, 2017). Therefore, research is needed to establish whether attitudes have truly changed.<nl><nl>The research question I was looking to investigate was \"What attitudes are present towards those who identify as non-binary?\". Key discourses to uncover include; what is considered normal with gender, the challenges non-binary people face and whether society is widely accepting of these individuals. This led to the development of the semi-structured interview schedule included as appendix 1. Looking at attitudes towards non-binary individuals meant a participant who was not non-binary could be selected. This facilitated discourse analysis and Willig’s 6-stage process was followed (Willig, 2008). Due to confidentiality reasons, the interviewee will be referred to as Anna.<nl><nl>Analysis<nl>Key discourses identified refer to the construction of \"others\", identification as a choice and the fluctuating permanence of societal views.<nl><nl>Construction of Others<nl>Anna used language in a way that constructed non-binary people as being separate others. Individuals were spoken about as if they were distinctly different to the interviewee, who identifies as a cisgender female, and to other members of society. This demonstrates the normalisation of identifying as your assigned sex at birth and the rejection of people who do not fit into the norm.<nl><data_extract><nl>The choice of wording being \"experienced something\" to describe non-binary identification almost has connotations of a religious or spiritual awakening. It seems to suggest that non-binary people have had an association with a higher power which had led them to think that they are more than male or female. As gender governs human lives, perhaps non-binary individuals are likened to being more than human. This comment is significant as it regards non-binary people in a higher respect than people who identify with just one gender. Even though they are considered to be others, this may be in a positive rather than negative light. The use of \"experience\" also assumes that non-binary individuals have not always felt this way and that something has occurred in order for this identification to proceed. This indicates a conscious choice, a discourse that will be explored further on.<nl>Despite the previous positive symbolism, Anna goes on to express the need for another category for non-binary people. She initially used the word \"definitely\", which has strong intentions, when explaining that this should be the case. This was retracted when repeating the end of the sentence suggesting that this was misspoke. This could indicate that this was her true opinion which may have then been altered in order to appear more socially acceptable and to fit in with the general consensus of a progressive society. This signifies that society as a whole may not be as complicit in ‘othering’ behaviour as Anna was herself.<nl><data_extract><nl>Again, Anna has added to the discourse of othering by the use of the phrase \"something else\" to refer to non-binary individuals. The choice of the word \"thing\" rather than person is dehumanising and creates a distance between her and non-binary individuals. Anna is no longer able to relate to the \"thing\" and an outgroup has been created. Social identity theory states that members of an ingroup believe that their ingroup is distinctive from and superior to the outgroup which then leads to discrimination against outgroups (Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1979). <nl>In this situation, non-binary individuals are considered to be inferior which aids prejudicial treatment.<nl><nl>In contrast to this, Anna uses the word \"we\" when saying \"we’re living in a free world\". Using this discursive tool places the interviewer, participant, non-binary and gender conforming individuals into the same societal group. This assumes that the free world is for everyone and the same privileges are received by all. She considers non-binary individuals to have the freedom to express themselves how they desire without persecution, which suggests a wider belief that society is permitting of people acting how they choose to. However, this does not indicate that negative attitudes have ceased, rather that people are just choosing to suppress verbal opinions.<nl><nl>Identification as a Choice<nl>Anna heavily drew upon discourses which presented non-binary identification as a conscious choice. Individuals were considered to have alternative experiences to those who identified with their assigned sex which led them towards their identification. This reveals how identifying with your biological sex is considered to be the default and other identifications are decision based.<nl><data_extract><nl>Anna has used the term \"believe\" once again when referring to non-binary people. Belief is an expression commonly used when declaring concepts that are intangible or that do not have a scientific basis, for example religion or mythical beings. Likening non-binary people’s existence to something that is either believed in or not indicates that their presence is not acknowledged by society as being authentic. By describing non-binary individuals in this way, it is extremely damaging to their sense of identity. Findings by Johnson et al. (2019) showed that invalidation in multiple social contexts contributed to negative affective and cognitive processes for non-binary adolescents which included confusion, self-doubt and internalised shame. This demonstrates that unconscious negative biases are held in society and these have detrimental effects for non-binary people.<nl><data_extract><nl>Anna used the phrase \"that’s become quite popular at the moment\" when talking about how people are identifying as non-binary. This is important as it does not denote permanence and likens this movement to a trend or a song. It suggests that people may decide to identify as non-binary while it is popular this year, but this phenomenon will be seen to disappear again as soon as it arrived. By using language in this way to create the discourse of choice, the experiences of non-binary people are invalidated. Their personal struggles with identity are minimised or even dismissed and struggles with stereotyping and bullying are disregarded.<nl><nl>Additionally, by using the word \"recently\" she does not acknowledge the rich and diverse history of non-binary identification and the consequences that derived from identifying in this way. This is due to a lack of knowledge and reflects the lack of queer education in society. A report from GLAAD found that increased knowledge about LGBT people led to lower levels of discomfort towards this community and reduced LBGT discrimination (GLAAD, 2014). This demonstrates that ignorance may be fuelling negative social attitudes and education could lead to a change.<nl><nl>Permanence of Societal Views<nl>Anna used language which implied varying degrees of permanence to current views. Some societal views were constructed as being temporary and some were constructed as being concrete and resistant to change. <nl><data_extract><nl>This quote was referring to the use of discrete categories for clothing in dress stores. By using the phrase \"it doesn’t have to be\" Anna acknowledges that there is room for improvement of societal attitudes. She suggests that if there was a large-scale change for example by a clothing company, then people would be relieved from the binary which would increase open-mindedness. This is juxtaposed by the phrase \"but it very much is\" which is contradicting to the original message. This implies that while there is the opportunity for enhancing the lives of others, there is a lack of drive. This negative outlook suggests that individuals in society are focused on keeping the superiority of their own ingroup, at the cost of the well-being of the non-binary out group.<nl><data_extract><nl>Anna used the phrase \"at the moment\" 5 times during the course of the interview. This was used when comparing non-binary activism to various social movements such as feminism, gender equality and Black Lives Matter. By using words such as \"minute\" and \"moment\", social movements are perceived to be current and short natured. This may show that years of activism go unnoticed by society if it does not benefit the majority. By constructing language in this way, Anna demonstrates how society is only able to comprehend one change at a time. Feminism is the sole focus and only when this is achieved, will non-binary issues take the forefront.<nl><nl>Anna also uses the word \"they\" when talking about equality. This choice of word removes responsibility from herself for actioning change. This suggests that only certain people hold this power, potentially only those in authority. This stance would explain why non-binary progression in society is slow as it reflects the belief that not everyone is in the position to make a difference. People either do not recognise that they could be valuable allies in fighting for queer rights, or they do not believe it is their place. By using language like this, Anna is recognising that non-binary individuals are not considered to have achieved equality in society. <nl><nl>To Conclude<nl>In deconstructing the language used by Anna to describe non-binary people, a main negative attitude prevailed which may be due to a lack of understanding. Discourses constructed non-binary individuals as being distinctly different to the interviewee and identifying this way by choice. Social attitudes were also constructed as having varying permanence. The inconsistencies uncovered reflect that there may be diverse social attitudes towards non-binary individuals.", "<addr3_FN>, <nl> <nl>What is the latest time that I can send a draft to you today? :) <nl> <nl>Kind Regards, <nl><nl><part_FN_SN><new>Hi <addr3_FN>, <nl> <nl>I already know that this isn't great because it has been rushed but here is a draft of my literature review.<nl> <nl>Kind RegardsBeste Grüße<nl> <nl><nl><part_FN_SN><nl><new>Hi <addr3_FN>, <nl> <nl>Thank you for the feedback, it is very helpful.<nl> <nl>I have just been looking at the template on <system> for the proposal as there is no conclusion, it just ends with a methodology.

{"id": "3a937600-ba3c-4e86-9992-a7d0e01edd27", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Police interviewing with eyewitnesses and victims has always been subject to scrutiny by psychologists and legal professionals. Over the past years, there has been significant psychological research in this area, with various new techniques being introduced and implemented in police training to ensure testimonies of eyewitnesses, victims, and suspects to be as accurate as possible. While these techniques can be applied to both eyewitnesses and suspects, victims of crime need particular care and consideration when being interviewed about the crime. One example of such victims are sexual assault victims. Studies have shown that only 16-20% of rape victims report the crime to the police or other legal justice systems (Kilpatrick et al.,1992). There are many reasons for such a low rate of reports; victims are likely to have PTSD (Karatas et al., 2020), they may be worried about confidentiality during interviews, both of which tie in with the belief that there’s a lack of training in police training when conducting interviews with sexual assault victims (Rich and Seffrin, 2012). This essay considers these factors and proposes two recommendations that the police should consider when interviewing sexual assault victims; 1) rapport building (Holmberg, 2004; Collins et al., 2002) and 2) the combination of the Cognitive Interview (Fisher and Geiselman, 1992) and an WRIP approach (Heydon and Powell, 2016).<nl><nl>A potential factor to consider when interviewing sexual assault victims is the method of  interviewing. A survey study has shown that among 429 police officers in the USA, many of them were not sufficiently skilled in conducting interviews with victims of sexual assault (Rich and Seffrin, 2012).  Such lack of training negatively impacts the volume of sexual assault reports the justice system receives. Therefore, it is important to implement a technique that addresses this issue of lack of training and in turn, encourages more victims to come forward and report sexual assault incidents. <nl>A key element of any police interview is rapport building. Rapport building is a type of effective communication skill (Vallano et al, 2015) that is characterised by establishing a positive and comfortable relationship and atmosphere between the interviewer and interviewee (Vallano and Campo, 2011). There are multiple ways in which a police interviewer can establish rapport with a sexual assault victim; addressing the victim by their name, active listening, adopting open body language (matching and mirroring the interviewee’s body language (Boe, 2009)), and maintaining frequent eye contact (St-Yves, 2006). Indeed, Holmberg (1994) (as cited in Holmberg, 2004) found that when rapport was used in an interview with a rape victim, the victim was more willing to narrate about the crime event as she claimed the interviewer encouraged her to describe the events in \"such an intimate way\" and felt he was doing it for \"her sake\" and not because it was \"for the investigation\". Moreover, Keats (1993) also found that when the technique of rapport-building was used in interviews, both the interviewer and interviewee were comfortable and appeared to freely discuss the events of the incident all while the interviewee demonstrated willingness to co-operate with the investigation.<nl><nl>Another advantage of rapport building is that it seems to elicit more correctly recalled information and more detailed information (Pinizzotto &amp; Davis, 1996; Collins et al., 2002). Therefore, not only does this technique increase willingness in victims to come forward and report sexual assault crimes, but it also increases the quality and quantity of information recalled by interviewees, an aspect that has always been a drawback of investigative interviewing.<nl>However, as with any recommendation, there are a few limitations to consider. While the notion of rapport-building is commonly known in the legal justice system and highly recommended by researchers and practitioners (Abbe and Brandon, 2013), it is important to note that the definition of rapport-building is not clear-cut, that is, much of the literature surrounding this technique includes a variety of definitions. While some researchers claim rapport-building involves creating a positive and friendly relationship with the interviewee (Collins et al., 2002; Hartwig et al., 2005; Vallano and Compo, 2011), others argue that it is defined as a neutral, working relationship between the two parties (Abbe and Brandon, 2013). With such conflicting definitions, it is hard for police interviewers to gauge a comprehensive understanding of rapport-building and hence may result in them not using the technique to its full potential.<nl>Nevertheless, a questionnaire study conducted on 221 police interviewers in the UK revealed that police officers reported using rapport 87% of the time during their investigations with witnesses (Dando et al., 2008). This suggests that despite the contradicting definitions of rapport-building, police officers are still seeing the value in the technique and as a result, are implementing it in their interviews. Therefore, rapport-building is a valuable and effective technique that should be administered during interviews with sexual assault victims.<nl><nl>Another key reason as to why many sexual assault victims do not come forward and seek help from the legal justice system is because many of them experience PTSD. Around two thirds of women were reported to have features of PTSD (Karatas et al., 2020). This may lead to victims being scared to come forward as they believe that the police would not be trained to efficiently deal with their trauma and fail to understand them. <nl>An example of police interviewing technique that the police are required to use in their investigative interviews is the Cognitive Interview (Fisher and Geiselman, 1992). As well as the 4 main stages of the interview – mental reinstatement of context, reporting from a different perspective, reverse order reporting and in-depth reporting – the interview, more importantly, involves an introduction and a ‘transfer control’ phase (Geiselman and Fisher, 2014). During the introduction, the interviewer asks the interviewee simple questions, attempting to build rapport. In the ‘transfer control’ phase, the interviewer informs the interviewee that they are the expert since they were at the scene themselves. These two steps are crucial in that they enable the interviewee to have a more favourable experience of the interview (Fisher and Geiselman, 2010), meaning their satisfaction levels of police services are likely to increase. These satisfaction levels, in turn, are linked to reduced levels of PTSD type symptoms (Kunst et al., 2013) in interviewees who have experienced traumatising events, such as sexual assault. <nl><nl>While the Cognitive Interview has many benefits and has been found to improve total and correct recall more so than the standard interview (Gwyer and Clifford, 1997), there are problems with its practical application. One problem is that police officers believe the interview is very time consuming and takes longer to conduct than a standard interview and thus, cannot conduct the full interview (Kebbell et al., 1999). Another issue is that it requires significant levels of concentration and cognitive demands on the police interviewer (Fisher and Geiselman, 1992; Kebbell et al, 1999). <nl>Therefore, with these limitations in mind, Heydon and Powell (2016) propose a possible technique that could be introduced to police interview training, as an addition to the traditional interviewing techniques, known as written-response interview protocol (WRIP). This approach involves anonymous and confidential written reporting options for sexual assault victims commonly before a traditional interview. An example of a WRIP approach could be that victims of sexual assault write their story in their own time – whenever they feel ready – with prompts and guidelines designed to focus their writing on key points as well as maximise their recall. This written format can then be followed up with a formal interview. In terms of anonymous reporting, a WRIP that aims to achieve this should include instructions that are consistent with the Cognitive Interview techniques. For instance, a WRIP for confidential reporting must begin with an ‘Engage and Explain’ phase that includes the Cognitive Interview’s ‘report everything’ phase. While still remaining anonymous, it is important to still engage with the interviewee, to show sensitivity to them. Thus, it is evident that this approach allows police interviewers to have a lot of flexibility when interviewing sexual assault victims. <nl><nl>With the WRIP approach, many of the Cognitive Interview limitations are addressed. By allowing victims to record their experiences themselves as soon as possible after the crime, the police interviewers can use those initial reports for reference during the face-to-face interview phase, reducing the cognitive demands imposed on them by the interview technique and reducing the time it takes to conduct a full interview. Furthermore, by incorporating these two techniques together, the victims’ satisfaction levels, rapport building, and the quality of their testimonies are not compromised, rather they are further encouraged. However, it is vital to note that there has been no further research on the combination of these two techniques and their validity in real life situations. Nevertheless, theoretically, this collaboration appears to be the ‘Golden Standard’ and ‘fool-proof’ in the context of investigative interviewing. Therefore, with such considerations in mind, the combinations of these techniques should be considered as a practice for gathering evidence from sexual assault victims.<nl><nl>In conclusion, interviewing sexual assault victims is tricky. Regardless of age, gender, size, etc. reflecting and talking about such traumatic events is not easy for any individual. It is possible that it is because of this sensitivity of the topic that many victims are reluctant to come forward and report the crimes done to them. Nevertheless, it is the legal justice system’s responsibility that they have such measures in place that allow the victims to feel even a little bit of comfort when coming forward. It is the police’s responsibility to ensure the victims feel as if they made the right choice by reporting the crime. Considering some of the factors that might prevent victims from coming forward, this essay proposes two main recommendations that the police could potentially introduce in their practice. Both of these recommendations have a key thing in common – building rapport. Thus, it can be concluded that in any type of investigative interviewing, building rapport is the most important aspect.", "r SirMadam,<nl>Application for work experience as a <job_title> at <school1>.<nl><nl>I'm highly interested in and would like to apply for the above role in your establishment for 2 weeks from the <DDth> <month> to <DDth> <month>.I am currently studying at <school2> as a year 12 student.

{"id": "5aab6140-e64d-43c7-9864-16ccd3d0d92d", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Introduction<nl>Enterprise Car Club operates across the UK, offering accessible, eco-friendly vehicles at a low cost for a small monthly subscription. Car Club are owned by Enterprise who provide car rentals, sharing and sales across 8,000 locations worldwide. <nl>Enterprise Car Club are looking to expand operations and target the student demographic of Birmingham. This plan offers solutions for the next 12 months to identify, target and market to the chosen demographic, whilst evaluating the individual methods and their collective effects. This marketing plan aims to boost brand awareness and grow the business and operations within Birmingham. <nl>Evaluation of market segment<nl>With 81,000 students in Birmingham (HESA 2020), this segment is a sizeable target market for Enterprise and presents a strong opportunity for the business. Car Club currently offers a package aimed at younger drivers however, it is important to remember that a proportion of students would fall outside of this ‘Under 22’ bracket, hence the suggested target demographic is 19 – 25. Marketing should be specialised for each package where possible. For example, promotions at fresher’s fairs should focus on the ‘Under 22’ package as this is most relevant to first year students.<nl><nl><nl>Market segments should be distinct, accessible, measurable and profitable. This demographic is distinctive within Birmingham from their abundant population on campus and active social-media usage, making them easily targetable. Students with busy lifestyles are most likely to use this service, those with part-time employment andor heavy involvement in student life (clubssocieties) would have the biggest need to travel around the city.<nl>This segment is easily accessible as these students are more likely to be present on campus due to their universityclubsociety commitments and can be targeted online through student social-media communities. Usage statistics on demographics, distance and potentially even purpose can be collected through the Car Club app allowing for easy measurability. Unique promo-codes allow for measuring of marketing methods efficiency through the app which is vital to measuring success.<nl>Finally, this segment has great profitability potential. Although the student community is not the most affluent, their large population (81,000 - HESA 2020) provides scope for a substantial profit. With competitive pricing and effective marketing, Car Club could compete against companies like Uber, changing the trend in student intra-city travel.<nl><nl>Positioning<nl>As Car Club is unique, the potential competition is diverse. For intra-city travel, Uber and Ola currently control the student market, with busses being another viable, low-cost option. For car rental, Majestic and Sixt both operate within Birmingham, offering users more freedom but at a higher cost.<nl>To identify Car Club’s market position, these perceptual maps evaluate the companies based on pricing, convenience and diversity. Price is key to driving business when targeting low-income students. Convenience is important regarding city travel as this can drive consumers away if it is lacking. For convenience, factors such as ease of booking, required walking distances, arrival time, vehicle availability, parking and requirement for rebooking were all considered. <nl>Finally, diversity was deemed vital as it reflects a consumers’ initial requirement for travel. The ability to hireutilise different vehicles enables consumers to travel with varied group sizes and bring any necessary luggage. As students rarely have access to their own vehicles, utilising vehicles for transporting belongings can be just as essential as transporting people.<nl><figure><nl>If we assume regular vehicle usage, Car Club leads the market for pricing. With base prices of £3.45-5.95hour, Car Club stands ahead of the bus and app-based taxi companies which start cheaper, at around £2.50 for short distances but grow substantially for longer journeys and return fares. It’s important to note that this depends on the nature of the trip, if the bus journey is short and direct then this would become the cheapest option. However, assuming customers will be travelling varied distances, they would potentially have to catch multiple busses, hence the lower rated bus pricing. <nl>Sixt and Avis start at £51 (Sixt 2020) and £60 (Avis 2020) for a day, with Sixt having an extra charge of £36day for our younger target market. Although this is a competitive hourly rate, the inability to hire by the hour makes this unaffordable for most student needs.<nl>The taxis command the market for convenience, with Uber taking a competitive-edge due to its greater vehicle availability and thus, lesser wait time. Car Club’s easy-to-use app comes a close second but is restricted by the walking requirements to reach and drop-off the vehicle. Sixt &amp; Avis have the same issue but require collection at specific locations such as Grand Central, rather than being spread across multiple locations like Car Club. Finally, the bus is least convenient due to the walking requirements and the lack of destinationroute flexibility.<nl>In summary, Car Club is the most cost-effective solution for student city travel, with the exception of short, one-way inner-city stints. However, as Enterprise lease vehicles in 30-minute slots, these customers are not within the proposed target market. As Car Club sits within the top segment for convenience, it holds a very strong market position, particularly against its car-hire competitors. Although not as readily available as Uber and Ola, Car Club is more cost-effective as multiple journeys are possible within the hire time. Its strong market position makes it a fantastic product to market to students and if advertised correctly, it has a high probability of success.<nl><figure><nl>Diversity is a tighter category than convenience, but Car Club still holds a strong position. This is an important consideration for students as, although their age ranges are similar, they will have different work commitments and will be involved in different aspects of university life. The vehicles therefore must cater for any eventuality, be it transporting one individual, a group or equipment for a sports team!<nl>The vehicle range Car Club possesses is essentially unlimited for students as there are small cars for inner-city travel, larger vehicles to carry big groups and the ability to hire vans for equipment transport, giving an edge on taxi companies. Car Club’s lack of luxury vehicles means a lower rating than Sixt however, the financially conscious student market has little demand for this category.<nl><nl>Car Club’s market position has significant potential, with affordability being the biggest asset. Car Club is also highly convenient and has a diverse range of vehicles at its disposable, making it a strong competitor within the city. It may be difficult to change the current trend of app-based taxi usage but with effective marketing, Car Club undoubtedly has the right product to do so.<nl>From Car Club’s positioning, its unique selling points (USPs) are clearly convenience, affordability and its multi-purpose fleet. The company also boasts short hire times (from 30minutes), app-friendly hire, a sustainable vehicle range (important to our target demographic) and an existing global network giving access to vital labour and capital for this venture. Enterprise prides itself on honesty and customer service which will also be demonstrated through marketing. Keeping prices low and maintaining the current fleet will be key to ensuring business growth in Birmingham.<nl><figure><nl>Vaughn (1980) published a journal featuring his FCB gridmatrix which is a useful consideration prior to beginning marketing. As the product is practical and relatively low cost, membership could fall into quadrant-3 and be deemed habitual. However, due to the low income of our target market and the commitment required for a monthly subscription, Car Club sits between quadrant 1 &amp; 3. Marketing should henceforth be focussed on factual rather than an emotive appeal. Consumers may need some information and persuasion before buying into the club, but the practical and effective product should become habitual for the consumer and should not require further promotions once established in their lives.<nl><nl>Campaign Objectives<nl>1) Expand Car Club within Birmingham by increasing the number of users on the app. Reach 8,100 signups by year end (10% of student population)<nl>As a new business within the city, Car Club must establish itself within the market, creating a customer base from which it can grow. Reaching 10% of Birmingham’s student population is an achievable target, especially when attending all fresher’s fairs (see below). Although these signups may not all become revenue-generating regular users, they are key to ascertaining a position in the market and will increase demand for Car Club through word-of-mouth promotion. Year-end signup statistics will demonstrate Car Club’s success, hopefully providing the company with an effective platform for further growth, enabling focus on new objectives such as customer retention.<nl><nl>2) Increase brand awareness by boosting on-campus presence. Attend all university fresher’s fairs within the city<nl>Attending five fairs is a very achievable target and will be easy to measure completion. These events are fantastic for changing student trends and encouraging new behaviour as open-minded freshers form a substantial proportion of the student population. Presence at these will initially create signups, but also will build brand awareness, increasing the likelihood of new users’ involvement in future promotions. Personal sellers working at the fair can offer unique, promotional signup codes, making tracking this objective simple, demonstrating the best universities for Car Club and which ones may need further investment. <nl><nl>Strategy and Rationale for Selected Tools<nl>The proposed strategy will incorporate push and pull features to both build brand awareness and to encourage habit-forming.<nl>Push strategy – Consistent advertisement throughout year to raise brand awareness with focus early on to encourage change in student’s current travel trends. Influencing them at this early stage will encourage them maintain this habit, increasing word-of-mouth promotion through their future university years. The push strategy is also key to match competitors’ attempts to infiltrate the market, without this, Enterprise’s new venture may be lost amongst its competitors.<nl><nl>Pull strategy – This takes advantage of the persuasive power of personal selling and focus on changing student trends. When supported with regular advertisement, it will create a lasting impression in consumers’ minds, leading to more signups and maintaining brand awareness.<nl>As part of the proposed pull strategy of personal selling, unique promotions can be offered to customers. This personal aspect adds value to the exchange and is more powerful than online promotions, it should increase signups and extend our loyal customer base. These customers’ positive feelings towards the brand should lead to increased word-of-mouth promotion.<nl><nl>Marketing tools plan<nl>Personal selling<nl>Personal selling is \"the process of person-to-person communication … in which the former learns about the customer's needs and seeks to satisfy those needs by offering the customer the opportunity to buy … a good or service.\" (Cant M.C. and Van Heerde, 2004, pg.3). Personal sellers’ presence on campus at  fairs and throughout the year will keep brand-awareness high, encouraging students to think of Car Club when in need of transport. Personal sellers can also persuade consumers using sales tactics and promotions, clearly explaining Car Club’s benefits and reacting to responses in real time. This creates a substantially higher probability of consumers making a purchase due to the sense of exclusivity and the increased memorability having more influence than a regular advertisement. <nl><nl>Promotions can be in the form of unique signup codes, enabling Enterprise to track the effectiveness of both the individual personal sellers and the campaign. This would illustrate the best sellers and locations, ensuring maximum efficiency. Promotions could also be offered in-app for the second hire to encourage habit-forming. Usage statistics of this offer would give a good indication of satisfaction with the service after the first use.<nl>Although personal selling is not renowned for dramatically boosting sales, the on-campus presence of personal sellers will help to maintain brand awareness. This will give Enterprise’s Car Club an edge on existing competitor options. A consumer that becomes a regular user through personal selling will better understand the brand and company values, making them a useful asset for word-of-mouth promotion. <nl>Testing<nl>Personal sellers’ ability to receive instant feedback makes them a useful asset for prepost-testing. Fresher’s fairs provide the opportunity to conduct surveys about travel habits and opinions on advertising. This allows Enterprise to adapt marketing methods if needed, prior to investing substantial capital into the  venture. Surveys could also be mandatory on signup for the app, gathering valuable data.<nl>Post-testing is also possible on the application, short surveys about where users heard of Car Club and general usage information could be vital to making effective future investments.<nl><nl>Advertising<nl>Advertising is \"a paid, mediated form of communication … designed to persuade the receiver to take some action, now or in the future\" (Richards &amp; Curran, 2002). Advertising will raise brand awareness and increase the app signups as interest is generated, thus achieving both marcomms objectives. Social-media will be the main advertising channel as our chosen demographic actively use technology and the internet. UCAS’ lifestyle survey (UCAS Media 2019) found that  \"77% of students are using Instagram, and 75% are using Facebook\". TikTok has also become popular within the student community since that article. Ads can easily be targeted to Birmingham students to increase click-through rates and relevance of the ad to the viewer. Picture and short video ads designed to demonstrate Car Club’s convenience and affordability will be used on TikTok, Instagram and Facebook. This should cover the most students’ social-media usage whilst remaining affordable.<nl>Alerts can also feature on the app to remind inactive users of the service. Advertisement efficiency can be measured by monitoring click-through rates, allowing the adverts to be adjusted accordingly to maximise effectiveness.<nl><nl>Integration of marketing communications <nl>Enterprise’s corporate values are honesty, customer service and sustainability, this fits our environmentally conscious ‘Generation-Z’ target market. Creating value to the consumer by focussing on customer service and unique, personal promotions will increase word-of-mouth promotion. Word-of-mouth promotion fits ‘Generation-Z’ as they are socially active ‘communaholics’, finding little distinction between online communities and real-world socialising. Their large online reaches have potential to quickly spread positive messages about the brand worldwide.<nl>Marketing will all be focussed on the affordability and convenience of the service, highlighting the company’s market position and standing by Enterprise’s key corporate value of honesty by sticking to facts. Personal selling will allow Car Club employees to communicate this directly to the consumer whilst emphasising good customer service. Advertising is a strong addition to the marketing-mix as relevant social-media ads can be directed to our target audience. Posters will be setup in convenient locations across the city, linking to the convenience of the service.<nl>The use of digital mediums to track the app-based service is well-suited and ensures focus on efficient technology, leaving no potential for error from crossover between paperwork and online.<nl><nl>Implementation plan<nl>Personal selling, app alerts and social-media advertising will follow flighting implementation plans, just running in key months. January and September both require intensive marketing as this is when students will be joiningreturning to the university and forming habits. Securing students as customers at this point should create habits for them to carry through the year. Personal selling will not be required on campus April – Aug and in December because exams and university holidays reduce student numbers on campus. This will save money, allowing for more intensive advertising investments in September. However, social-media advertising and app alerts will still occur during exam season (May) as students remain in the city and will require transport to and from their exams and across the city to other locations such as food shops.<nl>Posters will feature in key locations across the city where individuals may need transport such as the student union, student accommodation, supermarkets and shopping centres. As posters are relatively inexpensive, they can run continuously, attracting custom throughout the year. For example, the summer months and December are usually quiet for the student population, but due to school holidays and locals Christmas shopping, footfall will remain consistent throughout the year. Although this isn’t our target market, continuing advertising throughout the year will help to ensure a consistent revenue stream.", "r <addr23_FN>,<nl><nl>There was some confusion within our group about submitting coursework and how to do so meaning that our second submission (done by myself) was an hour or two past the deadline. As our first submission was before the deadline and they are both identical submissions, can I confirm that this will not be detrimental to the marks received at all? I presume it falls under the 5 day extension period we have been given by the uni for most subjects for submissions during Covid-19 but I just wanted to be sure of this!<nl><nl>Also, amongst the confusion I submitted my contribution twice as my initial attempt didn't include the required contribution declaration form.

I’d have taken you up on the offer of a call but as I have waited a week already for this meeting with <pers_FN> and it is so soon now, I will go ahead with that.<nl><nl> <nl><nl>Many thanks,<nl><nl><part_FN><new>Dear <addr9_FN>,<nl><nl> <nl><nl>Thank you for getting back to me so quickly, I really appreciate you taking this case higher for me. Many thanks!<nl><nl> <nl><nl>Kind regards,<nl><nl><part_FN><new>Dear <addr7_FN>,<nl><nl> <nl><nl>Thank you for the time you took yesterday to explain the current situation with Covid-19 and placements, but unfortunately the call has left me uncertain and quite frustrated.<nl><nl> <nl><nl>It is clear that the main issue the university has with my travel is the risk of contracting the coronavirus, however I believe that this single journey represents no greater risk than working in the UK. The BBC writes of an example of a 15hour flight with 350 passengers, two of which tested positive for Covid-19, after the lengthy flight none of the other passengers had contracted the virus. (Article) The article goes on to explain how the air in a plane is completely renewed every two to three minutes, making for a relatively safe environment.<nl><nl> <nl><nl>Obviously there will always be exceptions to this and there will never be a journey that is completely safe, but with body temperature scanning at airports and compulsory mask wearing, the industry is taking far more precautions than areas which I am exposed to on a regular basis such as shops and supermarkets. If this still isn’t satisfactory, I would be more than prepared to consider other travel options such as driving or taking a train to further negate the risk. However, I am confident the airline industry is taking the necessary precautions. In addition, I am more than happy to sign any waivers or disclaimers regarding insurance, which I will arrange myself. <nl><nl> <nl><nl>I will be able to self-isolate prior to travelling and will take private transfers at either end of the flight. This minimises the risk to just a single journey that would then facilitate my working in <country> for an entire year, providing me with invaluable work experience. Once in <country>, it is compulsory for me to register with the <organisation> for my health insurance. After which I will have access to one of the best healthcare systems in <continent>. With this to rely on alongside <country>'s impressive track-record of controlling the virus, I would be in very safe hands. Statistically, I am more likely to catch the virus in the UK! Worst case scenario, if I was to contract the virus in <country> then I would be fully entitled to quality healthcare and could rely on my connections in the country for emotional support so I would not feel stranded.<nl><nl> <nl><nl>Having recently spoken with my employer (<business>), they are more than happy to still take me on in <month> as they are starting to return to work already. Given that the employer still wants me, the fact I would be safer in <country>, the minimal risk of travelling and the fact that I have already arranged and paid for flights and accommodation, I struggle to see why the University would not permit my trip. <business> are abiding by all of <country>'s guidance for working safely during coronavirus and thus, all necessary precautions are in place as they would be in a UK organisation.<nl><nl>Delaying my placement or beginning it online would only detract from the vital experience that this scheme is designed to provide, leaving me stuck isolated at home in a very demotivating environment. I have previously worked from home in this same field so I would struggle to see any benefit of doing this again as I found the isolation to be mentally challenging.<nl><nl> <nl><nl>The thought of losing out on all that I have committed to this so far is immensely distressing and I feel strongly that attempts to stop me from travelling now is effectively penalising me for my hard-work and dedication to securing my placement so early. I have arranged flights and accommodation in addition to having also purchased a <language> home-speaking course and have been diligently studying specifically for this placement. It is also entirely possible that guidance will change in our favour before I am due to fly, with changes in policy occurring quickly and broad interest in loosening the current restrictions to allow businesses and markets to recover.<nl><nl> <nl><nl>I wholeheartedly understand the university’s stance on this matter and can see how it would apply to most cases. However, I believe it is clear that this placement would actually put me in a far safer location. Given my advanced state of my preparedness, my due consideration of risk, the importance of the placement to me personally and <business>’s willingness for the placement to go ahead, I would urge that you please reconsider your position for my case and refer this to whomever in the university is authorised to make such a decision.<nl><nl> <nl><nl>Yours Sincerely,<nl><nl><nl><part_FN_SN>"]}

{"id": "3e09f8d2-f281-48a3-af33-b88281235c41", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Abstract:<nl>This experiment investigates the alpha inhibition hypothesis (AIH) using a cued visual attention task through an electroencephalogram (EEG). The predictions for this study are that alpha activity would be higher for the left parietal lobe in the cue left (Cl) condition rather than cue right (Cr). 39 psychology students performed visual attention task and were cued to expect the stimulus on either the right or left. This study found that the left condition did have higher alpha amplitudes in comparison to the right condition when recording for P3. The findings for this study supported previous research and found that in conclusion the alpha inhibition is indicative of attention.<nl><nl>Introduction:<nl>‘High alpha is indicative of inhibition and disengagement of task irrelevant brain areas’ (Kilesch 2007) and is also reduced in task relevant brain areas. The findings of Handel et al (2011) showed that the stimuli presented to the participants visually were processed on the opposite side of the brain to where the stimuli were, and it is contralateral to the unattended side showing significantly higher alpha power. The results show that if a stimulus was to be presented on the left-hand side, it will be processed on the right side of the brain. A study by Sauseng et al (2005) which is being partially replicated by this study, asked participants to conduct a cued visual attention task and focused on different regions of the brain. The participants responded to a stimulus on a screen after being presented with an arrow that was an indication of which side the stimulus would appear on. The results show the side of the brain in which the stimuli had been processed, will obtain less alpha. There was also a significant effect of cue 200ms prior to stimulus onset recording from P3. These studies all show that alpha activity will be higher on the ipsilateral side in which the stimuli is shown, this supports the AIH. <nl>Therefore, supporting studies suggest that the hypothesis for this study is that the alpha amplitude would be higher in the Cl than the Cr, when recording from P3 on the left of the parietal lobe.<nl><nl>Method:<nl>Participants: A total of 39 undergraduate psychology students volunteered to be a participant, they were split into 5 groups.<nl>Design: The study was a repeated measures design as each participant saw both Cl and Cr conditions. The independent variable is the direction of the cue consisting of 2 levels whether it was left or right, and the dependant variable is the alpha amplitudes measured in microvolts (μV).<nl>Materials: Data was collected using a Biopac MP360. EEG electrodes were used, and AC cream was applied to help with the conductivity and reduce impedance. Everi cream to reduce skin impedance. PsychoPy is used to provide the stimuli and an event marker is sent to the Biopac. A large and small bar stimulus (figure 1a and 1b) in which participants focus their attention to. And arrow cues letting the participants know which side the stimulus will appear on, symbolised by the keys &lt; and &gt;.<nl><nl><figure> <nl><nl>Procedure:<nl>The Biopac channel was set up to record raw EEG 0.5-35 Hz and channels are set up to allow the left and right cue event markers to be accessed through PsychoPy, the event markers were used to identify when the stimuli were presented. Another channel is set up to record activity from the alpha frequency range (8-13 Hz), the sampling rate was 1000 Hz; 1000 observations recorded per second.<nl>The experimenter explained the objective to the participant and consent was given before proceeding, electrodes were then put into place. Following the ‘1020 system positioning’ the active electrode is placed on the P3 site on the left side of the parietal lobe in the brain. The reference electrode is placed at Fz and the earth electrode is placed by the participants hairline. Impedance checks are then done and were kept below 10KOhms. <nl><nl>Instructions were presented on the screen for the participants to follow, stating that a cue will appear indicating which side the stimulus will appear on; left or right. A fixation cross appeared in the centre then followed by a stimulus of a bar either large or small. Participants were then told to press a specific key depending on which bar was presented e.g., \"L\" for large bar and \"S\" for small bar. <nl>Practice trials were completed first to allow them to test run the experiment and understand what they are being asked to do. Participants took part in 4 different conditions with 3 repeats so a total of 12 practice trials. Once completed feedback was given to the participants. Similarly, to the practice trial, participants then took part in the real trial containing 20 blocks of 4 trials in which 50% of the trials cued left and 50% cued right all in a randomised order. In total there was 80 experimental trials.<nl>The cues were presented on the screen for 35ms. Then followed by a random inter-stimulus interval (ISI) this is set for 200ms to 1200ms. An event marker is then sent at the onset of the stimulus and the stimulus was then displayed for 50ms. Participants then proceed to respond.<nl><nl>During the study the experimenters explained to the participant what the task was, they put the electrodes in place and proceeds to the impedance test, then the experimenter begins the experiment for the participant to complete. The experimenter recorded the data which was then followed by debriefing the participant about the aims of the study. The experimenter helped to clean up the participant then proceeded to analyse the data that was recorded. <nl>Participants had to read the instructions that appeared before starting the experiment and follow these instructions by pressing certain keys and focusing on what appears on the screen.<nl><nl>Data treatment: <nl>When the experiment is running, event markers were sent to the computer, then to the biopac. This records exactly when the stimuli were presented, this allows the period 200ms before stimulus onset to be analysed for the Cl and Cr condition. <nl>The raw alpha data were then rectified regardless of it being either excitatory or inhibitory. This meant that any negative values were converted to positive values and an average deviation from 0μV was produced. <nl>The data was averaged over 50 samples to reduce extreme values. These data then become rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA). <nl><nl>Results:<nl><table><nl>Table 1 shows the results for 38 participants as one participant withdrew from the experiment, so no data is provided. A Shapiro-Wilk test was conducted to test whether the data was parametric or non-parametric. As the p value was less than .05, a non-parametric test was carried out. The median RAAA indicates that the Cl condition had higher alpha amplitude compared to the CR condition at the P3 site. A Wilcoxon signed rank test showed that the difference was significant (T= 566, n= 38, p= .002).  <nl><nl>Discussion:<nl>The findings support the hypothesis that there is greater alpha amplitude when the stimuli are Cl then when the stimuli are Cr. Our results are consistent with the AIH and Sauseng et al as alpha activity is contralateral to the side it is processed, and our results showed there was less alpha activity contralateral to the stimuli where the visual stimuli had been processed. This suggest that the side of the brain that is not involved with attention has less alpha activity. <nl>A methodological problem of this study is that attention could have been redirected due to being in a distracting environment in which multiple other students were talking. Evidence from previous research (Garrison &amp; Williams 2013) shows that participants do not perform as well when distracted and are more likely to make common mistakes when taking part in a task. To gain more accurate results these limitations will need to be controlled such as being in an environment with minimal noises, therefore helping the participant to focus better.", "<addr2_FN>,<nl><nl> <nl><nl>Yes, That’s fine with me.<nl><nl> <nl><nl>Please find attached the Job Description.

{"id": "6ca2c480-bb19-47f2-b933-cf05edb00e44", "discourse_types": ["essay", "memo"], "pair": ["\"Introduction.<nl>This essay will argue that the hostility shown towards good faith is justified and if anything English law needs to be more hostile to the principle of good faith. This is because the implementation of good faith towards commercial contracts is detrimental to the core principles and values commercial law prides itself upon. The principles which commercial law prides itself upon are: commercial certainty and party autonomy. If good faith is applied to commercial law, it affects both of these principles in some way, shape or form. Therefore, England’s commercial law courts will fall behind its competitors as the implementation of good faith may be detrimental to the highly acclaimed courts. This essay will show how the implementation of good faith will undermine these core principles.<nl>How good faith affects party autonomy.<nl>What is good faith?<nl>Good faith is defined as ‘a standard of conduct characterised by honesty, openness and consideration for the interests of the other party to the transaction or relationship in question’. Good faith can be included in a contract either expressly or it can be implied. If parties agree to deal with good faith and this is included in the final contract it will be enforceable, however it is not always this straight forward. Good faith can also be included through implied terms in a contract. The parties need to fulfil certain criteria to allow good faith to be implied in the contract. These criteria include: there must be no express terms of good faith, high degree of communication and cooperation, long standing commercial relationships, etc. <nl>To further develop this there are two types of implied terms; those implied by fact or those implied by law. ‘Terms implied by fact are those that a court will read into a contract so that it reflects the intention of the parties.’. ‘Terms implied in law are not terms that the parties to an agreement would have agreed to, but rather terms that arise as a legal incident of a particular legal relationship’.<nl><nl>What is party autonomy?<nl>Simply put party autonomy allows the parties, that are contracting with one another, to choose which laws will govern the contract between them. This in essence allows ‘commercial men to do business in the way they want to do it’ which was said by Lord Devlin.<nl>Party autonomy then gives rise to two more legal concepts which are freedom of contract and sanctity of contract. These two principles are used in court to enforce party autonomy. The definition of freedom of contract is ‘The parties are free to agree the terms of the contract that will govern their relationship’. This means that the business men will decide which rules they want to apply in their contract and the court will uphold this. Sanctity of contract is when ‘the courts should give eﬀect to the terms of the contract and should not be quick to invalidate contractual terms freely entered into. Accordingly, the courts will seek to uphold commercial contracts, unless the terms are overly restrictive or oppressive, are in breach of the law, or oﬀend principles of public policy.’. <nl>Party autonomy is extremely important to English commercial law, ‘despite statutory inroads, party autonomy is at the heart of English commercial law’. It can be seen as the heart of English commercial law as it allows business men to contract how they wish, allowing parties to conduct the arbitral process as they desire. Therefore, if good faith limits or alters the application of party autonomy it could be very detrimental to English commercial law. This will be discussed further.<nl>How implied terms of good faith affect party autonomy.<nl>The basis of party autonomy is to allow the contracting parties to decide what governs their contract. If the contracting parties wanted to include aspects of good faith within the contract, then they would have expressly included it within the contract. The implication of allowing implied terms to govern commercial contracts is that the parties no longer have as much control of what governs the contract. The parties include the terms that they see fit to apply to the contract. Therefore, if the court looked at the contract on surrounding circumstances and applied good faith which they did not intend to include into the contract, it would undermine the principle of party autonomy. <nl>The case of Yam Seng Leggat said ‘the relevant background against which contracts are made includes not only matters of fact known to the parties but also shared values and norms of behaviour’. Since the terms are not expressed there is no clarity and so a level of uncertainty exists when interpreting the circumstances surrounding the contracting parties. Since the contracting parties have no control over this, it directly affects party autonomy, ‘the \"\"implied\"\" duty of good faith that would undermine the terms the parties have seen fit to reduce to writing.’. The fact that the contracting parties exclude certain terms of good faith from the contract shows that this would be because they did not come to a proper agreement upon certain terms ‘the very fact that the parties have excluded from the text of the contract some specifications that were discussed during the negotiations indicates that no agreement was reached on those matters.’. Therefore, why should these terms of good faith be included if they could not agree upon them, hence why it would not be included into the contract. So why should the courts then say they implied these principles while drafting the contract and then apply them. If this were true it would have been drafted into the contract originally. Therefore, implied terms of good faith negatively affect party autonomy. <nl>How express terms of good faith affect party autonomy.<nl>On the surface express terms of good faith may seem to enhance party autonomy. This is because if the contracting parties want the law of good faith to apply, they can put it in writing as an express term. If they do this the court will enforce it. In the case of Petromec Inc v Petroleo Brasileiro SA Petrobras the contracting parties included a promise in the contract to negotiate in good faith. Since they had an express term of good faith within the contract, the courts could enforce the duty of good faith upon the party. Therefore, enhancing party autonomy as the contracting parties wanted the law of good faith to apply to the contract. ‘Party autonomy is enhanced by the Courts recognising and giving effect to the parties pre-contractual intentions’. <nl>However, express terms of good faith can be seen as more detrimental to party autonomy than beneficial. This is because good faith is a very loose term and thus creates uncertainty. ‘with it comes great uncertainty as to scope of the obligation and trying to determine the meaning of such duty, and its interaction with the other terms of the agreement’ the parties may want to include terms of good faith but they may be too vague in order to be enforceable in the contract. Therefore, party autonomy is affected as the desired laws may not be applied. ‘Even when a document…is intended by the parties to be legally binding, there are circumstances in which it may be regarded as too uncertain to be enforceable by a court.’. Also when applying express terms of good faith if they are not explicitly stating what the duty of good faith is it leads to uncertainty. This could lead the courts to interpret good faith in a way that neither party anticipated. Therefore, directly undermining party autonomy. <nl>How does good faith undermine commercial certainty?<nl>What is commercial certainty?<nl>Commercial certainty put simply is the ‘predictability of judicial decisions’. Commercial certainty in English commercial law is a major selling point as it is clear where the contracting parties stand in relation to the law when forming a contract ‘The law must be accessible and so far as possible intelligible, clear and predictable’. This is because the contracting parties contract off the precedent of past case law. Therefore, the contracting parties can anticipate and be certain of duties, responsibility and liability if needed. Therefore, once a rule has been decided parties will contract based upon this rule, so they will be certain that a similar outcome would occur. <nl>How does good faith affect commercial certainty?<nl>Implied terms of Good faith undermines commercial certainty due to the way in which good faith is applied within the courts. This is because the courts look at the surrounding circumstances such as the relationship between the parties etc. This can lead to uncertainty as the implementation of good faith can be vague and subjective. Good faith is very loosely defined which can lead to varying interpretations as to the meaning of good faith. Therefore the approach to applying good faith will be open to interpretation not giving consistency such as ‘ Is it the role of the courts to prescribe moral standards to which contractors must be judged by? It is subjective, in that ‘good faith’ only requires a clear conscience on behalf of both parties’. The danger is that the implementation and adjudication of good faith will be based upon ‘the basis of intuition, discretion or ad hoc decision-making rather than consistency’. <nl>This means in similar cases different outcomes could be reached, creating uncertainty in commercial law due to the application of good faith. If contracting parties enter a contract looking at precedent from a past case and they apply similar principles of implied good faith, they may not get the same outcome at court. This will cause uncertainty causing business men to contract elsewhere, as commercial certainty is essential to contracting parties. In Vallejo v Wheeler Lord Mansfield said ‘In all mercantile transactions the great object should be certainty; and therefore, it is of  more consequence that a rule should be certain, than whether the rule is established one way or the other. Because speculators in trade then know what ground to go upon’. Certainty is needed because the contracting parties want contracts to have strict performance so the contract can enforce the ultimate goals and intentions of the parties. Implied terms of good faith directly undermines commercial certainty as the contracting parties would not be sure of the outcome if they included implied terms of good faith into their contract. This shows that good faith is detrimental to commercial certainty, which commercial law prides itself upon. <nl>Conclusion.<nl>The general hostility to good faith as shown is extremely justified.  This is because good faith undermines the core principles of commercial law and will subsequently ruin the reputation of the English commercial courts, resulting in contracting parties to go elsewhere to contract with one another. If anything the English commercial courts could be seen as too lenient with the negative effects good faith is bringing to commercial law. These are not only short term problems with the contracting parties entering into contracts which are not suitable, but good faith is also destroying the core principles which commercial law is rested upon.<nl>Furthermore, party autonomy is not only a core principle of commercial law but also a major selling point to business men. This is because they can take control over their contracts, so they can fulfil the parties best interests without interference. However, good faith significantly reduces the freedom that these parties have. This is because implied terms of good faith may be applied through the courts even though it was neither of the parties intentions. Also with express terms of good faith there is very little clarity making it difficult to understand not only for the contracting parties but also for the courts. Therefore, good faith is attacking the very heart of commercial law.<nl>Finally, commercial certainty is another core principle on which commercial law is based upon. This unpredictability of cases will make contracting parties go to alternative places to proceed with dealings. This is because commercial certainty reassures and allows parties to contract with them knowing their commercial interests would be uninfringed upon. <nl>Therefore, English law has every right to have general hostility towards good faith. It could be argued that English law needs to be more hostile due to the damage good faith is doing towards commercial law.\"", "Hotel Haven- Â£150 per night with a total of Â£299 booked through TRIVAGO. In response to the requests and needs of the CEO this accomodation has been chosen to best facilitate these. Firstly, the hotel is situated right next to a harbour as the CEO requested the hotel be by the water. Next, there is a cafe only 32 metres away and so this will be less than a 1 minute walk to the said cafe. however, there are lots of other options in the local vicinity of Manda cafe is not up to the CEO's standards. There is also a museum of Finnish and international art situated only 800 metres away which amounts to a 10 minute walk. A resturant serving traditional local cusisine was also requested. Lappi Ravintola is a 13 minute walk from the hotel and has been awarded a rating of 4.5 stars with 1224 ratings. To buy her children there is a souvenir shop only 750 metres away which is a 9 minute walk from the hotel. For the evening as requested storyville may be of interest. Only a 10 minute car journey away it offers live jazz music on the evenings. There are also many more bars in the area so they are not in short supply. Finally, there is also a skywheel only 9 minute walk away which would be very nice in the evening watching the sunset over the ocean, or seeing the city lit up at night. Many thanks. Rob."]}

These firms have had a significant boost since 2002; also referred to as the ‘going global era.’ They tend to come from emerging, upper-middle income economies and developing countries and use a variety of entry modes such as joint ventures, strategic alliances and wholly owned subsidiaries (Guillen &amp; Garcia-Canal, 2009). However, the majority choose to expand rapidly into developed countries using M&amp;A’s and are late movers. A growing number of EMNE’s are starting to dominate certain industries such as banking, telecommunications and engineering and outward FDI from emerging countries is increasing. For example, China has increased its presence within the Fortune 500 between 2004 and 2019; whilst the presence of US firms has started to decrease, showing the ever-growing dominance of EMNE’s (Fortune Global 500, 2004,2019). There’s several firms many of us from the western world may not have realised are owned by EMNE’s, such as Tetley being owned by TATA – an Indian conglomerate; meaning it owns several different types of businesses and McVitie’s being owned by Turkish EMNE, Yildiz Holding.<nl>This essay will highlight the key differences between MNE’s and EMNE’s and examine how effective current theories are at explaining outward FDI from emerging country multinationals and compare and contrast them to the more recent theories which have been developed; including the LLL model and Springboard theory. Some academics believe these new EMNE’s have different motivations, which don’t necessarily fit in with the traditional theories; whilst others think that these theories can be applied just as effectively as the newer ones. <nl>Key differences between traditional western MNE’s and EMNE’s<nl>Only a decade ago many EMNE’s, which are booming today and challenging some of the most established MNE’s in many industries, were marginal competitors. So how have they managed to do this in such a short space of time and be successful? It’s important to look at the key characteristics of both traditional MNE’s and the newer EMNE’s to see what makes them so different. A main difference is the speed they internationalise. Many traditional MNE’s expand gradually, following the Uppsala model whereby they expand into countries which are psychologically close considering factors such as, geography, shared language and shared cultures. On the other hand, EMNE’s expand at a more accelerated pace. They do this to close the gap between their market reach and the global presence of MNE’s from developed countries (Mathews, 2006). A good example of an EMNE which has expanded rapidly is Chinese firm Huawei. In just five years, despite starting as a domestic firm in 2001, it was operating in over 100 countries by 2006. It did this by providing solid technology at low prices and hiring low cost engineers at 20% of western rates. This allowed them to strongly compete against western MNE’s and expand quickly (Fey et al, 2016). EMNE’s also use latecomer advantage whereby they learn from mistakes of MNE’s already established in the market and do better themselves. MNE’s are essentially used as ‘guinea pigs.’ With regards to ownership advantages many MNE’s have the required resources available to them internally; making this a big advantage if they were to expand into developing countries. However, EMNE’s are sometimes seen as having weak ownership advantages, but many believe this is debatable as their institutional advantages are so strong and they can also just obtain resources and capabilities through M&amp;A’s; which would naturally upgrade their ownership advantages. <nl>Institutional advantages are another key element to consider when comparing the firms. It’s well documented that traditional MNE’s have struggled significantly in countries with institutional voids as they’re used to political stability; due to coming from countries with highly stable environments. As a result, they don’t have the same experiences to cope with instability in the same way as EMNE’S. New EMNE’s are known to have this as a big advantage over traditional MNE’s, as they’re used to dealing and complying with discretionary and unstable governments in their domestic countries, therefore meaning they’re better prepared to succeed in foreign countries with weak institutional environments (Cuervo-Cazurra &amp; Genc, 2008). It’s also believed that if EMNE’s can successfully thrive in unstable developing countries, they most certainly can be successful in stable, developed countries. Finally, there’s key differences in the organisational adaptability of MNE’s versus EMNE’s. It’s believed that EMNE’s are much more adaptable than MNE’s which tend to suffer from inertia, by being stuck in their ways, as they have deeply ingrained values, cultures and organisational structures (Guillen &amp; Garcia-Canal, 2009). Consequently, they tend to have lower success rates with M&amp;A’s due to their lack of adaptability - almost two thirds of acquisitions by western firms end in failure, as the acquirer doesn’t give flexibility to the firm acquired. On the other hand, EMNE’s tend to have a high M&amp;A success rate - 67% success rate, as their adaptability is high, and they appreciate the firm they acquire more; due to their lack of global presence. <nl>Existing theories and their relevance<nl>Two major theories which explain the existing ways firms expand overseas successfully are Dunning’s Eclectic Paradigm and the Uppsala Model. Dunning uses OLI theory to explain why firms use outward FDI; suggesting the key advantages as being ownership advantages, location advantages and internalisation advantages. Ownership advantages refer to valuable resources and capabilities a firm offers a country it expands into, which gives them a competitive advantage. Many argue that due to their lack of capabilities and resources, coming from developing countries, EMNE’s can’t satisfy this part of the OLI paradigm. Going by Dunning’s explanation this would mean that they’re unable to engage in outward FDI, however many still do and are proven successful. Furthermore, some believe EMNE’s from developing countries could be considered to have ownership disadvantages, as they lack a well-known image and may not have the ability to compete on the same scale as western MNE’s, who have larger finances and advanced technologies (Fey et al, 2016). In addition, location advantages are required by Dunning to expand overseas effectively; this is what host countries can offer to a firm undertaking FDI there (Dunning, 1979). However, many EMNE’s don’t go abroad to access location advantages, such as lower cost production, lower labour costs or cheaper technology; as they already have this available to them in their domestic markets. For example, many Chinese firms won’t outsource their production to a developed country if they’re to expand their firm into them, because it’s well documented that production and labour within China can be done at a much cheaper cost to say that in the US.  As both ownership advantages and location advantages aren’t satisfied in the OLI paradigm, it makes it possible to say that the theory could become redundant or less relevant as more EMNE’S become successful in developed markets; without having satisfied all three elements within the paradigm. <nl>Secondly, the Uppsala model is another model used to explain the internationalisation of firms. It emphasises how firms go abroad incrementally and increase commitments gradually. This may mean they go into countries close to their domestic market first. A firm may first export to a country, then open an overseas subsidiary and finally build or acquire their own factory abroad as they gain more knowledge about the market and establish their operations. EMNE’S are unfortunately thought to leapfrog some steps outlined above and may even start the internationalisation process by becoming ‘born global’ and setting up the factory first. According to Eriksson et al (2000), the Uppsala Model is based on the idea that the behaviour of the internationalisation process is path dependent. Path dependence is a process based on the accumulated knowledge from the firm’s past international experience, which directs the firm’s future trajectory (Eriksson et al, 2000). A main concern is that Uppsala explains this path dependence but EMNE’s have no experience in developed countries to use. As a result, they can only use knowledge of developing countries. On the other hand, MNE’s know all about operating in developed markets so are at a bigger advantage. Finally, part of the Uppsala model is the idea of psychic distance - entering countries psychologically close. A main issue with this idea is that EMNE’s may not be able to use psychic distance to enter developed countries because they’re so different in nature. For example, developing countries may have stronger cultural, language, political and legal differences to developed countries. This would also be the case for MNE’s looking to expand into developing countries. <nl>The development of new theories<nl>As time has progressed new theories have been developed to try to explain and analyse how these new EMNE’s have used outward FDI to expand their presence internationally. The reason for creating these theories is because many couldn’t understand how these firms from countries with weaker country specific advantages could compete against the firms from developed countries. At first glance, it appears these EMNE’s have weaker firm specific advantages compared to their western rivals. <nl>The springboard theory was created (Luo and Tung, 2007) to explain why these firms expand so aggressively and the drivers behind this. The theory highlights seven elements. The first being that EMNE’s use their international expansion to compensate for their ownership disadvantages; this means that to counteract the fact they can’t offer a lot initially in terms of resources to the new market, they expand internationally and benefit from other means such as gaining resources from another firm through a M&amp;A. Immediately, this makes the OLI paradigm seem less relevant, as it’s highlighting that they can still be a success without initial ownership advantages. The second element of the theory says that EMNE’s use the international expansion to overcome their latecomer disadvantage; this means that they benefit from being able to see where MNE’s have made mistakes and ensuring they don’t make the same ones. Next, it explains that MNE’s from developing countries use international expansion as a springboard to counter-attack global rivals’ major foothold in their home country market. It also outlines that EMNE’s use outward FDI as a springboard to bypass certain trade barriers, such as quotas and anti-dumping penalties. This means that they go into another developingemerging markets with fewer restrictions. For example, if a Chinese firm were to set up a foreign subsidiary or production in Mexico and then export their good to the US. This again goes against the OLI paradigm as the firm isn’t directly using the location advantages of the US for production in the example above. Instead, they’re choosing to use those of Mexico to then sell in the US. Furthermore, the theory says new emerging MNE’s expand internationally to alleviate domestic institutional constraints. This for example could be if their home country doesn’t have strong patent laws, so they take their product elsewhere to be better protected therefore, benefitting from the county’s location advantage of having stronger patent protection. The final two elements explain that EMNE’s use international expansion to both secure preferential treatment offered by emerging governments and exploit their competitive advantage in other markets. To secure preferential treatment a domestic firm, say an Indian firm, may set up a subsidiary within the UK and then invest back into India to gain the tax benefit and the preferential government treatment. <nl>A second new theory developed is the LLL model (Mathews, 2006). This model has similarities to the Springboard theory in the way it explains why EMNE’s expand and internationalise. However, the key takeaway is that it says EMNE’s go abroad and then they learn. This is a massive contrast to the Uppsala model which emphasises the gradual process of expansion and firms using the knowledge they already possess to expand into markets with similarities, that are psychologically close. Firms going abroad and then learning highlights a more aggressive approach to expansion.  The three L’s in the model stand for linkage, leverage and learning. The linkage element examines the collaborations between EMNE’s and foreign firms through entry modes such as joint ventures, M&amp;A’s and alliances. Leverage explains that EMNE’s exploit global linkages to become ‘latecomers’ by harnessing resources and cost advantages to compete globally.  The second ‘L’ really highlights the idea that firms go abroad and then learn from the foreign partners already in the market and demonstrates why Dunning’s theory is less relevant of initially having certain ownership advantages to be successful. Finally, the learning element is the stage where EMNE’s acquire competitive advantages and learn how to compete internationally. Firms don’t need initial advantages necessarily; as they can expand and then learn and therefore become competitive. Overall, this model argues that firms acquire resources and learn over time before internationalisation occurs and the EMNE is integrated into the international activities. <nl>Although these theories have been developed and are more tailored to the new types of EMNE’s, they do still have their drawback such as underestimating the importance of absorption capacity and they go against the path dependence theory; as expressed in the Uppsala model. Finally, it’s clear that the importance of ownership advantages is dismissed; which is a key element in the existing OLI paradigm. <nl>In summary, it’s evident EMNE’s and traditional MNE’s differ both in the way they operate and the way they internationalise. Key differences include the speed EMNE’s internationalise compared with MNE’s and how differently they use or even don’t use their initial ownership advantages to ensure success abroad. Although they have their differences, both types of firm have proven to be successful in their own ways. However, there’s still a huge question mark over how these newer EMNE’s have prevailed so much globally. Thus, newer theories have been developed to try and explain this dominance. It must be said that although these new theories more accurately explain the rapid growth of EMNE’s and why having ownership advantages isn’t as essential as some older theories may suggest; they do still have their criticisms, as explained above. Consequently, further theories may have to be developed which are more accurate and less open to scrutiny. However, it really depends on individual views as to which theories are considered more relevant. Some would argue Dunning and the Uppsala model have been used for many years and can still be used effectively today, whilst others may say the world is constantly changing, as seen with the recent rise of EMNE’s, and therefore it’s necessary to keep developing and updating new theories. This will make them most effective and relevant to the current situations firms and countries find themselves in. For example, Carl Fey and others developed a new 5M framework which guides academics in their understanding of the internationalisation of EMNE’s (Fey et al, 2009). It proved that internationalisation is challenging for any firm. The largest challenge for EMNE’s, which is not always covered by the older theories, is overcoming the problem of a negative country image (Y.Y. Chang et al., 2009; E.Chang &amp; Taylor., 1999; Ferner et al., 2005; Smith &amp; Meiksins, 1995). It’s the job of newer theories to potentially provide insight into how EMNE’’s can overcome this challenge.", " could end up killing people tho you don't get that do you<new>Tier 3 is tier 3 you can't be ignorant to this. <county> has 3 hospitals in top 10 for being overwhelmed and they can't do normal operations due to number of beds x<new>This is serious!

In response to the requests and needs of the CEO this accomodation has been chosen to best facilitate these. Firstly, the hotel is situated right next to a harbour as the CEO requested the hotel be by the water. Next, there is a cafe only 32 metres away and so this will be less than a 1 minute walk to the said cafe. however, there are lots of other options in the local vicinity of Manda cafe is not up to the CEO's standards. There is also a museum of Finnish and international art situated only 800 metres away which amounts to a 10 minute walk. A resturant serving traditional local cusisine was also requested. Lappi Ravintola is a 13 minute walk from the hotel and has been awarded a rating of 4.5 stars with 1224 ratings. To buy her children there is a souvenir shop only 750 metres away which is a 9 minute walk from the hotel. For the evening as requested storyville may be of interest. Only a 10 minute car journey away it offers live jazz music on the evenings. There are also many more bars in the area so they are not in short supply. Finally, there is also a skywheel only 9 minute walk away which would be very nice in the evening watching the sunset over the ocean, or seeing the city lit up at night. Many thanks.

Creative solutions must be novel and acknowledged by society. The study of creativity consists of the 4 p’s which focuses either on, creative people, creative processes, products of creativity and creative places (environment).<nl>According to the psychometric approach, participants are tested using mental tests for direct measurements. However, such tests often confound intelligence and creativity, because not all creative people are high in IQ. Supporting this theory, Guilford (1956) distinguished between convergent and divergent thinking. He proposed that convergent thinkers find one best solution to a problem whereas, divergent thinkers can lead to many solutions to the same problem. He concluded that, creativity is a form of divergent thinking, because it brings many unrelated ideas together, also known as insight. Therefore, creativity makes use of methods which test divergent thinking such as the \"unusual uses test\" by J.P. Guilford (1967). Although divergent creativity tests are time consuming, they provide accurate measures of creativity than convergence.<nl>Creative Insight can occur in three ways (Sternberg and Davidson, 1982). Firstly, selective encoding refers to most important information being extracted from what is available. Secondly, selective combination is known to be the best way of combining information is perceived. Lastly, selectively comparison, whereby the information for the current problem being solved is related by analogy to a similar problem in one’s past, which often uses mental images (Shepard 1978). Utilising these steps, creativity can be made easier to obtain. <nl>The biographic and autographic approach for creativity is idiosyncratic and makes major use of peer judgments.

{"id": "961eeec2-40a1-4571-8308-6443300ee9f6", "discourse_types": ["essay", "text_message"], "pair": ["Within the study of Psychology, the Biological and Psychoanalytical perspectives have contributed immensely in relation to its similarities and differences of its core assumptions and features. As the assumptions within the Biological perspective consist on behaviour being solely a result of biology such as neurotransmitter and genetics; in comparison to the core assumptions of the Psychoanalytical perspective which consist of behaviour-based experiences within the environment and the unconscious. In the following essay, I will discuss the key features and assumptions of both perspectives revolving around their similarities and differences. <nl>The Biological Perspective adopts the nature approach to behaviour, as its assumptions solely revolve around the concept of behaviour is hard-wired. This is evident within its explanation for disorders such as Schizophrenia as Gottesman (1991) found that Monozygotic twins hold the highest percentage of 48% who are at a ‘Lifetime risk of developing schizophrenia\" in comparison to the 1% of the General population. This statistic supports the nature adoption of the biological perspective, as it states that behaviour is a result of Heredity as result of monozygotic twins sharing 100% of their genes. <nl>On the contrary, the Psychoanalytical perspective adopts both nature and nurture approach within its assumptions. As Freud proposed the assumption that our behaviour is controlled by the tripartite construction of the mind consisting of the Id, Superego and Ego.  Freud (1949) states that the Id \"contains everything that is inherited\"; this concept of inheritance similarly aligns with the biological perspective of nature having an influence on behaviour. As the Id is considered as the primitive part of the mind which includes innate instincts \"which are sexual in nature and the death instincts such as aggression\" (Benjamin, 2007, pg. 118). Alongside the nature aspect of this perspective, this perspective also adopts a nurture approach to behaviour in relation to the environment also having a major influence on behaviour. This is evident within the super-ego component of Freud's theory of the mind which is shaped by societal values and family upbringing.  This is developed during childhood essentially acting as a conscience within behaviour and moral guidance in \"attempting to thwart id desires\" (Benjamin, 2007, pg. 119). In addition to the super-ego, this perspective emphasis on nurture is also evident within Freud's Psychosexual stages of development. As the process of each stage contributes to the development of one's personality, for example during the ages 4-6 gender identity is formed through Oedipus complex (for males) and Electra complex (for females) during this Phallic stage the child will experience unconscious sexual desires for their opposite-sex parent. This unconscious desire is resolved through the child identifying with the same sex parent, therefore, leading the child to form an appropriate affection for their opposite-sex parent. However, Freud proposed the idea if this conflict was not resolved it would result in complex behaviours such as promiscuity and narcissism.<nl>Despite, both the Biological and Psychoanalytical perspective varying within the nature or nurture approach to behaviour, both perspectives possess a deterministic view of behaviour. As the core assumptions of the Biological Perspective holds the view that behaviour is solely a result of genetic factors and biological components. Similarly, the Psychoanalytical perspective upholds the same notion of determinism in its explanation of behaviour being controlled by instinct drives alongside with the environment also having control over behaviour.<nl>A further difference within these perspectives is the approach in relation to explaining its core assumptions. The Biological perspective adopts a reductionist approach in its explanation of behaviour as it attempts to explain behaviour through simple components such as genes, brain structure and neurotransmitters. This is evident within findings that serotonin and dopamine have a ‘signalling effect on later-life in relation to somatosensory, anxiety and depression' (Suri et al, 2015, p. 318); therefore, this supports the reductionist view of the biological explanation as it reduces complex disorders such as depression to neurochemical basis. Alternatively, the psychoanalytical perspective adopts both a reductionist and holistic approach to explaining behaviour. The use of reductionism is evident within Freud's' explanation of reducing behaviour to the instinctive drives within the unconscious mind. Despite this, this his approach differs as he also adopts a holistic view of behaviour as he considers the individual. This is apparent within the case of Anna O, who suffered from Hysteria a psychological disorder which involved psychological stress manifesting into physical symptoms such as ‘multiple personalities, speech difficulties, bizarre hallucinations, and inability to drink' (Benjamin, 2007, p. 116); these physical manifestations were a result of her grief from her father's death. This case supports the holistic feature in the Psychoanalytical perspective, as it considers other factors alongside unconscious drives which contribute to behaviour in comparison to the core assumptions of the biological approach which is narrow in its assumption. <nl>Furthermore, alongside the difference in their approach to explaining behaviour both perspectives also vary in investigating their core assumptions. The biological perspective is reliant on quantitative methods which provide objective measurements such as brain scans to measure the brain and behaviour; this is apparent within methods such as fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) which measures the blood flow of the cerebral cortex; consequently, thus providing support for the key biological features of the perspective.  This is evidently seen within research into disorders such as Depression as fMRI scans showed that depressed patients \"demonstrated more pronounced connection between the right frontal eye field and cerebellar area \"in comparison to healthy patients who demonstrated \"showed stronger connectivity between more than 20 frontal, temporal, and subcortical regions of interest and cerebellum\" (Bezmaternykh, D.D. et al, 2018, p. 734).  <nl>Alternatively, the core assumptions of the Psychoanalytical perspective revolve around qualitative methods which are subjective in nature. This is apparent with the case of Anna O as discussed above which is a central feature within the Psychoanalytical Perspective as it paved a way for the use of subjective methods such as talking therapy; therefore, providing a deeper insight on the individual than solely on numerical data as evident above within the biological perspective. <nl>By the same token, both perspectives also differ on carrying a scientific discipline whether its assumptions and features can be falsified. This is evident within the consistent falsification of the biological approach. This is evident within the contribution towards the theory of Neurons through the work of Golgi and Cajal. As Golgi produced the ‘first clear pictures of nerve cells' through a staining technique from this he inferred that the nervous system consisted of many neurones but was physically connected to each other (Goodwin, 2015 pg. 74-75). In opposition to the work of Golgi, Cajal proposed the idea that neurones were not physically connected to each other using Golgi's staining technique to support his claim. As result of the falsification of Golgi's theory, Cajal’s work has had a major contribution to the key features of the biological perspective due to the gap between the neurones to now be known as the synapse, this being a pinnacle feature of the biological perspective to explaining the behaviour through neurotransmitters.  From the consistent vulnerability to falsification within the features of the biological perspective, it is apparent that the perspective holds a scientific discipline. <nl>However, it can be argued that the Psychoanalytical perspective holds a similar scientific discipline in relation falsifiability as Hunt (2009) refers to Freud's work being ‘fiercely attacked on one ground or another' therefore providing the psychoanalytical approach with some scientific discipline as its assumptions can be both ‘strengthened and weakened' (pg. 225). This is evident within the development of Neo-Freudians such as Alfred Adler (1870-1937), who rejected the oversexualised perspective associated with Freud's psychoanalytical perspective but focused on the social aspect regarding primary determinates of behaviour such as environment and uniqueness of individuals. Therefore, introducing a different branch from the Psychoanalytical perspective as Individual Psychology. <nl>Finally, despite possessing a similar element of scientific discipline, the psychoanalytical perspective contrasts the biological perspective regarding its scientific credibility due to the subjective nature present within the core assumptions. This is evident within the feature of the Psychosexual stages regarding the development of gender as Freud argued that female gender identity was formed from possessing penis envy as they believed to have been castrated. This theory of female identity essentially within psychoanalytical perspective essentially lacks the scientific discipline in comparison to biological perspective as this feature within the assumption appears to base on ‘Freud's views of women' than evidence and fact. (Benjamin, 2007, p. 130).<nl>In conclusion, despite both the Biological and Psychoanalytical perspective holding majority of differences within their assumptions alongside the nature of their key features holding similarities both perspectives have successfully become an integral part of Psychology today.", "ess you have my birth certificate easily accessible?

{"id": "6d04aa78-27fe-4cdf-bd94-eabf794d2dbf", "discourse_types": ["essay", "memo"], "pair": ["<question1><nl><nl>The period of adolescence is a time where behaviour is characterised by impulsivity, increased risk taking and an affinity for peer groups (Spear, 2010). During no other period in the lifespan is the prevalence of death so high relative to health, with Steinberg (2013) reporting a dramatic spike in self-inflicted behaviours such as car accidents and crime. Adolescent behaviour and the reasons for its occurrence has posed a particular question for researchers. <nl><nl>The duel systems process model proposes that adolescent typical behaviour is caused by a developmental imbalance between the subcortical socioemotional system implicated in sensitivity to rewards and novelty, relative to the cognitive control system responsible for impulse and emotional control as well as decision making (Shulman et al, 2016). The model hypothesises that the early activation and maturation of the ventral striatum (specifically the nucleus accumbens and amygdala) in early adolescence increases one’s propensity for sensation seeking whilst the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is still maturing, therefore attenuating impulse control (Harden &amp; Tucker-Drob, 2011). It is predicted that sensation seeking behaviour increases at the early stages of adolescence and levels off as adulthood is reached, following an inverted ‘U’ shape trajectory. Harden &amp; Tucker-Drob (2011) assessed this using longitudinal data from over 7000 participants aged 12-24, looking at self-reported changes in impulsivity and sensation seeking. They found that mean levels of impulsivity declined through adolescence and levelled off when participants reached their mid-20s, consistent with neurobiological research suggesting heightened activation of the ventral striatum in early to mid-adolescence relative to children and adults (Barkley-Leveson &amp; Galván, 2014). This supports the claim that adolescent typical behaviour is a product of nature due to the profound influence of brain structures and their relative levels of maturity on sensation seeking behaviour.  Harden &amp; Tucker-Drob’s (2011) research is one of the first to report this trend using longitudinal data and to utilise such a large sample, representative of a diverse population. Furthermore, the use of such a large data set reduced the chance of type I errors. However, caution should be taken when drawing conclusions due to the risk of social desirability and response bias when using measures of self-report. <nl><nl>It has been asserted by some researchers that adolescents possess the ability to evaluate risky decisions to the same level as adults (Reyna &amp; Farley, 2006), begging the questions as to why this age group engage in risk behaviours to such a degree? Observational data suggests that peer influence is a primary factor contributing to adolescents heightened propensity for risk (Albert et al, 2013) with researchers suggesting adaptive benefits such as increasing peer status and peer affiliation with desirable social groups (Spear, 2010). Steinberg &amp; Gardener (2005) assessed the effects of peer contexts on risky decision making in 3 age groups including adolescents (13-16), youths (18-22) and adults (24+). All 306 participants completed 3 measures of risk orientation including 2 self-report measures and a computerised driving task named the Chicken Game. In this task participants were required to make decisions about whether to advance the vehicle once a traffic light turns from green to yellow (meaning an impending red light) with the possibility of a car crash if the car advances through a red light. Participants were randomly assigned either the peer condition where they would complete the task with 2 others or the alone condition. Steinberg &amp; Gardener found that each group engaged in comparable risk taking when alone but increased risk taking when in the presence of peers, more pronounced during middle and late adolescence. This suggest adolescents’ susceptibility to peer influence relative to adults when taking risk, implying the role of nurture and social contexts in adolescent typical behaviours. This study has important implications for interventions seeking to reduce risky behaviour amongst adolescence (i.e. juvenile delinquency) suggesting attention should be directed towards increasing resistance to peer influence in young people. However, this study has arguably low ecological validity as it unable to capture the complex dynamic of risk taking with peers outside of a laboratory setting.<nl><nl>In conclusion the cause of adolescent behaviour appears to be a combination of both nature and nurture influences, with research suggesting that peer influence may increase the brain’s risk and reward system sensitivity (Albert et al, 2013). Subsequently, the duel process model and effects of peer stimuli may co-influence risky behaviours seen in adolescents as young people spend most of their time with peers (Spear, 2010). Therefore, the claim that adolescent behaviour reflects the influence of nature more so than nurture is not supported. <nl><nl><question2><nl><nl>Research suggest adolescence is the greatest risk period for the emergence of psychopathological disorders, with mental illness affecting 1 in 5 young people (Powers &amp; Casey, 2015). In light of this, this essay shall seek to critically discuss how brain development may facilitate the high prevalence of psychopathology during adolescence.<nl><nl>Stress has been considered an important factor contributing to adolescents’ vulnerability to internalising disorders, namely anxiety (Romeo, 2010). Brain areas identified as being implicated in this increased vulnerability includes the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis which undergoes significant maturational changes and a reawakening during puberty (Spear, 2010). The HPA axis is responsible for controlling stress-induced hormonal secretion in response to stressors and does so by stimulating the release of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary gland into circulation (McCormick et al.,2010). Once released, ACHT acts to increase the production and release of glucocorticoid hormones, which then act upon the brain to predetermine future responses to future stress stimuli. Using a battery of acute stressors, Elland &amp; Romeo (2013) assessed the hormonal stress response of prepubescent rats, compared to that of adult rats and found a greater, more prolonged ACHT and corticosterone response in the younger rats compared to adults. Elland &amp; Romeo (2013) suggested that it takes twice as long for these hormones to return to baseline level in premid-adolescent rats following stress stimuli relative to adult rats. Reflective of the results seen in animals, researchers have speculated that anxious individuals may show a delayed HPA axis recovery following a stressor, which in turn may make them slower to adjust to novelty, giving rise to psychopathological vulnerabilities (Spear, 2010). Caution should be taken when interpreting these results to human behaviour because of the use of animal data. However, it is increasingly difficult to assess levels of glucocorticoid in human adolescents because of the natural diurnal release rhythm it follows (Spear, 2010), meaning animal studies have provided a valuable opportunity to investigate this, whilst having strong experimental control. Furthermore, animal research is able to bypass the ethical implications to be considered when conducting human research (Eiland &amp; Romeo, 2013). <nl><nl>Attention deficithyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) can be defined as inappropriate levels of inattention and hyperactivityimpulsivity relative to an individual’s age, that interferes with their functioning (Shaw et al., 2012). Onset of ADHD is around 7 years (occurring before puberty) and is prevalent in over 5% of children worldwide (Friedman &amp; Rapoport, 2015). Research has suggested that brain development through late childhood and adolescence is an important factor contributing to ADHD. Shaw et al (2007) assessed this using a longitudinal MRI scan study of 223 ADHD diagnosed participants matched with 223 typically developing (TD) controls.  Shaw and colleagues found a marked delay in ADHD in achieving peak cortical thickness throughout the cerebrum and prefrontal cortex (PFC). This delay was most pronounced in the middle and lateral PFC, implicated in higher-level cognitive functions such as attention and planning, where peak thickness was achieved 5 years later than TD controls. In addition to this it was seen that the primary motor cortex conversely showed early maturation in ADHD (peaking age 7 years), when compared to controls (peaking age 7.4 years). Shaw and colleagues speculated that the delayed developmental trajectory of regions implicated in higher-order motor control, paired with the early maturation of the primary motor cortex may account for symptoms seen in ADHD i.e. poor motor control. This influential study was seen to be the first longitudinal neuroanatomic research evidencing the theory of delayed cortical maturation in ADHD, due to the advanced in MRI techniques seen in recent history. However, it should be noted that the results cannot endorse differences in intelligence and sexual dimorphisms seen in ADHD, despite their effect on cortical development because they strictly controlled for in the design. <nl><nl>To conclude brain maturation and development in adolescents, relative to adults seems to have implications for various psychopathologies. Spear (2010) suggests for disorders like ADHD where onset occurs just prior to adolescence, motor control regions may show developmental anomalies, whereas disorders with adolescent aged onset i.e. anxiety, show developmental differences in the frontal regions. It can be speculated that the PFC’s immaturity in adolescents relative to adults, may be sensitive to the reawakening and prolonged effects of the HPA axis. However, brain development is not the only factor giving rise to psychopathologies in adolescents with mental health varying by person. Instead some researchers propose the stress-diathesis model, suggesting an interaction between genetic vulnerabilities and environmental stresses, predisposing certain individuals to psychopathologies during adolescence (Spear, 2010).", "In-line with your requests for the the trip, you will be staying in the Radison Blu Royal in Kamppi from the 2nd-4th Sept.

{"id": "9acd41b5-0cf4-4926-a928-97e1e1ac1d7b", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["\"Autism Spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder (Hodges et al, 2020). A diagnosis of ASD according to the DSM-IV-TR entails a minimum of two social impairments, one communication and one in restricted and repetitive behaviours (RRB) (American Psychiatric association, 1994). The ‘Big 3’ psychological theories are Theory of Mind (ToM); Weak Central Coherence (WCC) and executive dysfunction (ED).<nl>ToM is the ability to attribute mental states to oneself and others (Tager-Flusberg, 2006). 80% of children with ASD, failed the Sally Anne false belief task (which investigates ToM) (Baren-Cohen, Leslie &amp; Frith, 1985) compared to typically developing (TD) children. However, 20% of children still passed. This doesn’t account for performances by higher-functioning individuals with autism (HFAI), as Happe (1995) states passing false-belief tasks are predicted by verbal mental age. Furthermore, Happe’s 1994 strange stories test found individuals with autism (IWA) showed difficulties with irony, sarcasm, and metaphors. This can account for social and communicative impairments such as sustaininginitiating 2-way conversations, subsequently causing  failure to develop peer relationships. However, this may be due to under-connectivity in left-hemispheres (Verley et al, 2014). In addition, IWA also showed difficulty in reading eyes tasks (Baren-Cohen et al, 2001), which suggests impairments of joint attention (JA). Furthermore, children with autism, have impairments in following eyes andor giving appropriate eye contact (Neumann, 2006), as well as issues using declarative gestures. Baron-Cohen (1994) stated this was due to a deficit in shared attention, according to mind-reading system. This can explain social and communication impairments e.g., lack of shared enjoyment and failure to use non-verbal behaviours. However, ToM fails to account for RRB such as a tendency for routinesrules and circumscribed interests. <nl>ED involves deficits in planning, inhibition, and cognitive flexibility (Rajendran &amp; Mitchell, 2007). IWA show poor cognitive flexibility in the Wisconsin card sorting task (WCST) (Nelson, 1976). This can be due to perseverative behaviour. However, Minshew et al (1992) found perseverative ability is linked to verbal IQ as they found no differences between TD and HFAI. Thus, ED cannot solely and universally explain deficits. Furthermore, IWA have planning deficits illustrated in Tower of Hanoi task (Ozonoff &amp; Jensen, 1999). However, Hughes (1996) found IWA were able to do puzzles requiring  fewer steps. Although planning isn’t completely impaired, disruption of routinesrules causes distress to IWA (Rajendran &amp; Mitchell, 2007).<nl>Studies aforementioned do not account for individual differences, as performances may be different in HFAI due to  Verbal IQ. Furthermore, ED also occurs in individuals with schizophrenia and Tourette’s who perform similarly to IWA on executive function tests (Rajendran &amp; Mitchell, 2007).  This limits the potential of ED as a diagnostic marker for ASD. <nl>The Weak Central Coherence theory (WCC) (Frith, 1989) states IWA possess a bias towards local elements. Evidence for this is in embedded figures (Witkin, 1971) and block design tasks (Shah &amp; Frith, 1983), in which children with ASD displayed superior performance. Furthermore, Happe (1996) found IWA weren’t susceptible to visual illusions. These local biases can account for IWA showing pre-occupations for parts of objects. In further support, Hobson &amp; Lee (1998) found IWA do not process faces as a whole as they weren’t susceptible to inversion effect, due to this local bias processing. Furthermore, IWA show activity in primary visual cortex, linked to perception (Chung &amp; Son, 2020) which can explain performances, therefore, WCC isn’t a sole explanation for superior performances. Frith &amp; Snowling (1983) found IWA failed to use appropriate associations on homograph tasks, as they focused on sole words instead of the whole context, further supporting WCC. This can explain social communicative impairments such as sustaining conversation or developing relationships. Although, Lopez &amp; Leekam (2003) found IWA were able to use appropriate word associations in their visual homograph task suggesting such deficits are sensitive to task modalities.  <nl>In conclusion, the ‘Big 3’ psychological theories contribute to the ASD clinical profile to an extent.  ToM can account for social and communicative impairments, but not universally, as well as inability to explain RRB. Although, EDT can account for RRB i.e., adherence to routinesrules, is not exclusive to ASD. The WCC accounts for social and non-social behaviours but brain regions also play a role. This shows ASD is a multiple deficit disorder without a one theory fits all. The fractionation theory suggests the 3 domains are distinct at a cognitive level (Happe &amp; Ronald, 2008), but Russell et al (1991) states there is overlap between all domains highlighted in performances and theories, thus further research is need on domain specificity.<nl><nl><question2><nl>Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit atypical behaviours compared to typically developing individuals (TD). Lower-level processes such as  enhanced perceptual functioning (EPF); social motivational theory (SMT) and spontaneous mimicry (SM) may account for such differences.<nl>Evidence for EPF arises from embedded figures task (Witkin et al, 1971), as well as block design tasks (Shah &amp; Frith, 1983) in which children with ASD show superior performance to TD. In block design tasks, children with autism also show no further advantage to pre-segmented designs. This is due to perceptual processes being enhanced in ASD, which leads to locally orientateddetailed focused perception, compared to weak central coherence (WCC) which outlines a bias towards local elements (Charman et al, 2013). Thus, EPF highlights superiority in perceptual processing compared to processing style in WCC. Furthermore, IWA perform faster than TD children on conjunctive visual search tasks (Plaisted, O’Riordan &amp; Baron-Cohen, 1998) which further supports IWA have enhanced perceptual discrimination (Plaisted, O’Riordan &amp; Baron-Cohen, 1998) as EPF enables IWA to discriminate against colours and features resulting  in this faster processing. <nl>EPF can also explain savant skills, which are more common in ASD than the general population (Mottron et al, 2006), which highlights strengths of ASD. For example, exceptional drawing skills are due to EPF, as this encourages IWA to avoid perceptual closure, leading to more accurate and detailed focused drawings (Chamberlain et al, 2013). However, EPF doesn’t explain why this only occurs in some IWA, as there may be individual variations in processing perceptual information. <nl>EPF can also explain atypicality in sensory symptoms in IWA. Due to this enhanced perceptual processing, the threshold of detecting sensations is lowered (Lawson et al, 2015). However, Triomphe et al (2019) found IWA have atypical Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) modulation (linked to inhibition) which also explains tactile hypersensitivity in ASD. Therefore, EPF isn’t a sole explanation of why hypersensitivity occurs in IWA. Another limitation is EPF fails to explain why hyposensitivity occurs, and thus has weak explanatory power regarding sensory processing. <nl>Another low-level process in ASD is SM.  In electromyography responses in IWA, SM of emotional expressions is shown to be atypical (Beall et al, 2008) andor delayed (Oberman, Winkielman &amp; Ramachandran, 2009). SM is important for socio-emotional reciprocity, as Chartrand and Bargh (1999) found being mimicked makes people like us more. SM also underlies empathy (Drimalla et al, 2019). Therefore, this can explain impairments in developing relationships in ASD as well as a  lack of shared enjoyment displayed in ASD as IWA prefer to play on their own (Chevallier et al, 2012). <nl>The SMT explains deficits in social cognition related to lower-level processes.  Eye-tracking experiments by Klin et al (2002) found children with ASD look more at the background than characters in static social photographs. Furthermore, Vlamings et al (2010) found IWA have impairments in processing and identifying faces. According to EPF, this is due to enhanced processing of high spatial frequency information, an atypical process focusing on fine perceptual detail. However, the SMT states IWA  have less motivation to attend to faces as it is less rewarding, and this lack of experience can lead to poorer processing (Chevallier et al, 2012).<nl>Furthermore, Chamberlain, Rothman-Fuller and Kasari (2007) found children with ASD prefer isolated tasks compared to collaborative. Chevallier et al (2012) found this is due to selective social anhedonia (inability to feel social pleasure) in adolescents with ASD and this correlates with ASD severity. This explains impaired initiating and responding to in children with ASD in joint attention.   <nl>In conclusion, the above theories can contribute to atypical differences in ASD. EPF can explain atypical differences at a social and non-social level in ASD. SMT involves deficits in orienting to social information and behaviours which maintain social interaction (Chevallier et al, 2012), explaining social and communication impairments. Although, this cannot account for atypical restricted and repetitive behaviours (RRB) shown in IWA. In addition, despite SM being able to explain atypical social behaviours, it fails to explain communication and RRB. Failing to  account for a whole domain shown in IWA entirely shows serious limitations in using these theories for an explanatory power of the full ASD clinical profile. Furthermore, evidence given in support of these studies are task-dependent and artificial, such as eye-tracking and facial processing experiments as they do not reflect real-life settings. Likewise, lab studies lack validity and therefore may not be extrapolated. The above theories aren’t universal across all IWA as individual variations occur due to it being a spectrum disorder, as well as co-morbidity. Further research needs to be conducted on individual variations on atypical differences.<nl><nl><question3><nl>Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit atypical behaviours compared to typically developing individuals (TD). Lower-level processes such as  enhanced perceptual functioning (EPF); social motivational theory (SMT) and spontaneous mimicry (SM) may account for such differences.<nl>Evidence for EPF arises from embedded figures task (Witkin et al, 1971), as well as block design tasks (Shah &amp; Frith, 1983) in which children with ASD show superior performance to TD. In block design tasks, children with autism also show no further advantage to pre-segmented designs. This is due to perceptual processes being enhanced in ASD, which leads to locally orientateddetailed focused perception, compared to weak central coherence (WCC) which outlines a bias towards local elements (Charman et al, 2013). Thus, EPF highlights superiority in perceptual processing compared to processing style in WCC. Furthermore, IWA perform faster than TD children on conjunctive visual search tasks (Plaisted, O’Riordan &amp; Baron-Cohen, 1998) which further supports IWA have enhanced perceptual discrimination (Plaisted, O’Riordan &amp; Baron-Cohen, 1998) as EPF enables IWA to discriminate against colours and features resulting  in this faster processing. <nl>EPF can also explain savant skills, which are more common in ASD than the general population (Mottron et al, 2006), which highlights strengths of ASD. For example, exceptional drawing skills are due to EPF, as this encourages IWA to avoid perceptual closure, leading to more accurate and detailed focused drawings (Chamberlain et al, 2013). However, EPF doesn’t explain why this only occurs in some IWA, as there may be individual variations in processing perceptual information. <nl>EPF can also explain atypicality in sensory symptoms in IWA. Due to this enhanced perceptual processing, the threshold of detecting sensations is lowered (Lawson et al, 2015). However, Triomphe et al (2019) found IWA have atypical Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) modulation (linked to inhibition) which also explains tactile hypersensitivity in ASD. Therefore, EPF isn’t a sole explanation of why hypersensitivity occurs in IWA. Another limitation is EPF fails to explain why hyposensitivity occurs, and thus has weak explanatory power regarding sensory processing. <nl>Another low-level process in ASD is SM.  In electromyography responses in IWA, SM of emotional expressions is shown to be atypical (Beall et al, 2008) andor delayed (Oberman, Winkielman &amp; Ramachandran, 2009). SM is important for socio-emotional reciprocity, as Chartrand and Bargh (1999) found being mimicked makes people like us more. SM also underlies empathy (Drimalla et al, 2019). Therefore, this can explain impairments in developing relationships in ASD as well as a  lack of shared enjoyment displayed in ASD as IWA prefer to play on their own (Chevallier et al, 2012). <nl>The SMT explains deficits in social cognition related to lower-level processes.  Eye-tracking experiments by Klin et al (2002) found children with ASD look more at the background than characters in static social photographs. Furthermore, Vlamings et al (2010) found IWA have impairments in processing and identifying faces. According to EPF, this is due to enhanced processing of high spatial frequency information, an atypical process focusing on fine perceptual detail. However, the SMT states IWA  have less motivation to attend to faces as it is less rewarding, and this lack of experience can lead to poorer processing (Chevallier et al, 2012).<nl>Furthermore, Chamberlain, Rothman-Fuller and Kasari (2007) found children with ASD prefer isolated tasks compared to collaborative. Chevallier et al (2012) found this is due to selective social anhedonia (inability to feel social pleasure) in adolescents with ASD and this correlates with ASD severity. This explains impaired initiating and responding to in children with ASD in joint attention.   <nl>In conclusion, the above theories can contribute to atypical differences in ASD. EPF can explain atypical differences at a social and non-social level in ASD. SMT involves deficits in orienting to social information and behaviours which maintain social interaction (Chevallier et al, 2012), explaining social and communication impairments. Although, this cannot account for atypical restricted and repetitive behaviours (RRB) shown in IWA. In addition, despite SM being able to explain atypical social behaviours, it fails to explain communication and RRB. Failing to  account for a whole domain shown in IWA entirely shows serious limitations in using these theories for an explanatory power of the full ASD clinical profile. Furthermore, evidence given in support of these studies are task-dependent and artificial, such as eye-tracking and facial processing experiments as they do not reflect real-life settings. Likewise, lab studies lack validity and therefore may not be extrapolated. The above theories aren’t universal across all IWA as individual variations occur due to it being a spectrum disorder, as well as co-morbidity. Further research needs to be conducted on individual variations on atypical differences.<nl><nl><question4><nl>Apraxia of speech (AoS) is an acquired motor speech disorder (Ballard, Granier &amp; Robin, 2000). Phonological representation is intact and there is no difficulty in motor realization, but there is an impairment in converting representations into a motor plan; this results in but isn’t limited to; phonological and phonetic speech errors, distorted prosody and groping (visibleauditory attempts to find right position for articulators) (Galluzzi et al, 2015). There are many accounts regarding the cognitive difficulties underlying apraxia which I will compare and contrast.<nl>Firstly, there is an impairment in knowledge, specifically, a loss of knowledge of word-sized articulatory programmes. The hypothesis states there is damage to a direct word route which impairs retrieval for articulatory planning. Instead, speakers have to use a less efficient, laborious route. Varley and Whiteside (2001) state some apraxic speakers (AS) have lost the ability to access stored plans and thus assemble speech from smaller units, which causes dysfluency shown in AoS. Furthermore, Varley, Whiteside &amp; Luff (1999) found there were no frequency effects in word durations with 4 AS. However, results weren’t significant. Contrastingly, Aichert and Ziegler (2004) propose brain damage in apraxia causes a loss of lower frequency routes and perseverations of higher frequency ones. This is consistent with a similar notion AS have an impairment in knowledge of the spatio-temporal parameters associated with speech, such as word retrieval in speech production,  which has also led to imprecise motor planning (Shriberg, Aram &amp; Kwiatkowski, 1997). Ziegler &amp; Cramon (1986) support this as they found AS have difficulties in knowing which parameters to use or knowing timings of lowering the velum, which can cause phonetic errors.  <nl>The reduced buffer capacity hypothesis (RBCH) is another account of cognitive difficulties underlying apraxia (Rogers and Storkel, 1999). Firstly, a limitation in the articulatory output buffer which is involved in phoneme-articulatory conversion. The speech motor buffer can only fit one syllable at a time; this can account for syllabic segregation, false stops, and  pauses between syllablesconsonants in AS. This means AS can’t activate several speech motor programmes simultaneously (Galluzzi et al, 2015). Secondly, there is reduced efficiency of the articulatory planner as the process of phonological to auditory conversion has become slower andor less precise (Buchwald &amp; Miozzo 2012), similar to the hypothesis above. This accounts for slower speech shown in AS with impreciseness explaining phonetic errors produced. In addition, RBCH states speakers may simplify consonants as they are more difficult to produce e.g., CCV template to CV template  (Bernhardt &amp; Stemberger, 1998). Deger &amp; Ziegler (2002) support this as they found AS had longer reaction times (RT) when producing alternating syllables and use simplification to reduce complexity. This explains pauses between syllable and phonemes, and consonant elongations. Both studies however have small sample sizes and aren’t generalisable across all AoS speakers. <nl>The program retrieval deficit hypothesis (PRDH) however states cognitive difficulties in AoS is due to interference in accessing articulatory plans. There is competition amongst motor programmesplans for selection due to similarity, and this generates errors and dysfluency in AoS (Mailend et al, 2019). This is supported by Mailend &amp; Maas (2013) who found AS showed significantly longer RT to say a pre-specified word when distractors were presented. Moreover, Galluzzi et al (2015) found frequency effects may be due to errors of selection due to an intrusion of phonetic  competitors; this interference activates corresponding phonetic words. In another study Mailend et al (2019) contrasted RBCH with PRDH. AS in their study were expected to show longer RT when prime and target words were different compared to identical (switch-costs). They found the switch-cost was more significant compared to other groups, as predicted by the PRDH, not the RBCH. However, this may be  due to participants knowing the target prior, which could jumpstart activation or from interference from competitors activated by the prime. Deger &amp; Ziegler (2002) found AS took longer to initiate two different syllables ‘da-ba’ compared to identical syllable sequence (da-da), which RBCH cannot explain as the ‘da’ is loaded to the buffer first and identical. <nl>In conclusion, there are numerous accounts explaining cognitive difficulties in AoS. All accounts above can propose for groping and have similaritiescontrasts of their perspectives of why impairments occur in AS.  However, experimental tasks aforementioned are limited as results may differ ranging from the severity of impairments, as brain damage and addition of Aphasia in some speakers could yield different results. Therefore, there isn’t one account which can explain all cognitive difficulties of AoS as results for experiments are inconsistent. Further research into the different hypothesis’ can help tailor treatments for AS.\"", "<addr5_FN>,<nl>I had a question I had completely forgotten about regarding the placement assignment.

{"id": "b024d844-3c0c-4dc1-8fb4-0318a76fbb57", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Introduction<nl><nl>Enterprise Rent-A-Car is an organisation with the largest position of largest transportation solutions provider in the world. They offer a variety of transportation including; car-sharing and exotic car hiring. Enterprise Holdings is its parent company with over 100,000 branches worldwide, employing more than 100,000 people (Enterprise.co.uk, 2020). <nl><nl>Enterprise Holdings acquired City Car Club expanding to ‘Enterprise Car Club’ who hold a variety of fuel-efficient cars and vans rentable by the hour or day, through mobile devices for bookings, unlocking and returning using iOS and Android applications with tailored plans (Enterprise Holdings, 2020). <nl><nl>Membership entails fuel servicing, breakdown cover, insurance, cleaning, and MOTs. A vehicle is only paid for when required not otherwise. <nl><nl>This report will demonstrate a yearly period plan including different actions split over months to boost brand awareness amongst the student demographic at Aston University. <nl><nl>Segmentation, target market, differentiation and positioning <nl><nl>Segmentation is the process of dividing markets of potential customers into specific groups based on common characteristics, reducing the risk of an unsuccessful marketing campaign. The segmentation will investigate students on and off campus interested in vehicle usage whilst at university (TrackMaven | The Marketing Insights Company, 2020).<nl><nl>A target market is the group of individuals a business aims to sell its products and services to, where marketing messages can be crafted effectively once the market is established (Omicsonline.org, 2020). The target market is aimed towards the student demographic at Aston University on and off campus coming from different towns and backgrounds. It is innovative to allow students to drive flexibly instead of incurring the cost of a vehicle overall for commuting. The segment could become profitable through promotional activities and distribution channels after identifying the segment’s needs. (Marketing-Insider, 2020).<nl><nl>Differentiation of Enterprise Car club is offering a self-service car rental plan, tailored to students at cost-effective prices with virtual membership and option to rent by the hour or day, alongside a monthly membership option currently priced at £5.95 per hour and monthly prices at £6 per month subscription. This is more accessible to a younger demographic of students who typically use mobile technology frequently. Aston University students could see this as an opportunity to benefit by not spending significant amounts, especially with current rising costs of living. <nl><nl>Positioning refers to a business’s ability to influence perceptions of consumers concerning a brand or product. The main objective is to establish an identity of an offering, so customers perceive it positively (TrackMaven | The Marketing Insights Company, 2020). <nl><nl>Enterprise is a company that is going to be offering a cheap and available service to students alongside reducing carbon footprints(reference). This could attract segments of the demographic, who favour being conscious of the environment for the future. (reference)<nl><nl>Enterprise Rent A Cars’ already significant profile to allow consumers to feel safe with the company’s new service, proving the reliable position they already pose compared to competitors such as CO-wheels CarClub and SIXT. Students can be targeted through social media platforms and through campaigning on university campus similarly to UberEATS, by employing campaigners to increase awareness.<nl><figure><nl>A perceptual map is a tool used to differentiate competitors and highlight any gaps in the market. It shows our business as a high quality and low-price service, highlighting the potential for the brand to succeed and gain awareness amongst students. One of our main competitors is SIXT, discovered by constructing this perceptual map, we have established our advantage as we offer suitable age restrictions on the use of rentals as students will want to travel inside and outside of Birmingham more frequently. <nl><nl><figure><nl>Campaign objectives <nl>Specific is a clear, precise and directional objective put forward to understand what results are expected within the workforce, instead of the objective being generalised, causing confusion and poorer results (Lalama, 2015). An effective goal would be to increase sales by a certain percentage or increase the target on a weekly, monthly or yearly basis. <nl><nl>Our specific objectives are <nl>1)To attain 500 (or more) student buyers of the service before year-end at Aston University to reach our precise objective. <nl>2)To improve awareness of the Enterprise Car Club for the car rental service <nl><nl>Measurable measures a goal and is the stage where numbers come into fruition to keep track of progress. However, it can be difficult to understand if an objective has been reached. <nl><nl>Our measuring will be through:<nl><nl>1)Using surveys to measure student’s demand based on needs and wants, <nl>2)Identifying any potential niches. <nl><nl>This would allow the measurable objective of attaining 40-50 subscription members each month and link to the founding values of the company to honour consumers by listening to them.<nl><nl>Achievable goals are setting goals in a realistic period by taking small, planned steps towards a goal. <nl><nl>1)An example of a goal to be set is attaining data within each quarter of the year alongside aiming to increase brand awareness by 10%. Additionally, once achieved, the goal can progress to 20 new subscription members to achieve progression. <nl><nl>Overall this will contribute to the objective of reaching out to Aston University staff and students, with reasonable pricing that is visibly differentiated to competitors.<nl><nl>Realistic is forming goals based on the context of current economic, organisational and market conditions (Anon, 2020). <nl><nl>1)The current economic state will determine the likelihood of success when aiming to increase sales, as this would not be the best goal to set if the country is close to experiencing a recession period in their economic cycle.<nl><nl>2)Being the best low-cost provider is an example of a realistic goal for Enterprise CarClub profile competition, considering economic uncertainty in the UK because of Brexit. People may be less inclined to invest in vehicle ownership or maintenance because of the potential future inflation rate and currency value volatility.<nl><nl>3)Targeting 500 students as dealing with a small target market in the geographic location of Birmingham, this is a link to what we want to achieve and realistic. <nl><nl>Targeted &amp; Timed is using a specified deadline to reach a goal. If a time expiration does not exist, it will hinder efforts towards an achievement and evaluation.<nl><nl>1)Trying to achieve the specified number by the end of the year at Aston University, the target will be achieved through pushing collaborations through social media, helping target and appeal to the target market. <nl><nl>2)Customers will be more engaged with the services being offered, whilst measuring the effectiveness of this approach during and after and if results are proving unsatisfactory, measures can be taken to improve consumer satisfaction (Fill and Turnbull, 2016). <nl>Strategy and general rationale for specific tools <nl><nl>In the marketing strategy, there has been research on five stages, concerning our strategy. In initial thought, developing a strategic mission, vision and values allow Enterprise CarClub to set its standard to consumers and provide a positive image for their services. Setting objectives as stated in campaign objectives would be important to reach the vision, but meeting targets will only be possible if a strategy is tailored to the intended path. Executing the strategy would be the next step aided by prerequisites put in place, for example; a Gantt chart to work with, values to work towards goals and a mission to work on present communications to gain significant awareness. After executing the strategy, the focus is on analysing the external environment continuously, alongside the company’s internal situation to identify corrective adjustments (Gamble, Thompson and Peteraf, 2019).<nl>General rationale for specific tools selected:<nl><nl>In the marketing plan, looking further into advertising as a negotiated form of traditional and digital communication from an identifiable source can influence audiences. In the marketing plan, we are looking to follow a push strategy through Enterprise’s profile to attract the target market to buy subscriptions. It will allow Enterprise CarClub to reach the goal of building awareness with students, encourage and incentivise them to build a differentiated strategy in competition with others. A community of consumers can be built alongside the strategy by considering and monitoring brand image. (Richards and Curran, 2002).<nl><nl>Secondly, Sales Promotion is going to be used as it influences consumers in a way to buy a product (Fill and Turnbull, 2016). It is a tool that will influence student behaviour positively as incentives will be offered to trial the service initially and then decide to proceed if satisfied. A pull strategy will reel in consumers through discounts, bonuses, and coupons creating a feeling of need for the service. <nl><nl>Marketing Tool Plans- <nl>Advertising Tool<nl>Advertising is a strong form of communication that will enable Enterprise CarClub to reach their audience through engaging using a variety of resources, using the media category to carry advertising messages to allow for the use of billboards, magazines, digital newspapers and mobile and online advertising (Fill and Turnbull, 2016). <nl><figure><nl>Digital media has a strong level of interactivity in modern lives with social media being very prominent, for example, Instagram. Using this tool will provide Enterprise with a giant opportunity for advertisement (Fill and Turnbull, 2016). It is prefered to use this tool because of the benefits it will bring in terms of reaching a wider audience, especially with electronic word of mouth having a large impact and high level of users. Advertising holds the credibility to support marketing efforts such as; sales promotion, using methods to secure customers into the car rental subscriptions as consumers spend on what they believe will bring them reputable value. <nl><nl>Advertising holds the capability of effecting knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, behaviour of a target audience, persuading individuals to buy a product they have never purchased. It can suggest that advertising can increase sales using manipulative and psychological techniques with a large segment of passive consumers concerning the ‘Strong’ theory of advertising (Fill, 2009). <nl><nl>The (AIDA) model presents creating brand awareness of a product or service, the interest of the benefits of its uses to build sufficient foundation to encourage the buyer to research further, desire to go forward with an emotional connection through brand personality making consumers want it and action to make the buyer take the next step of engaging in making a phone call, signing up to a newsletter or engaging in a live chat for further information.<nl><nl>With awareness, a PR campaign can be running towards the student target market each month with different resources. Interest wise we could use surveys to gain student interest on campus to then offer further consultation after gaining the initial interest of what is important to their tailored service. Desire could lead to running local buzz campaigns to generate discounts due to the curiosity of a new service. An action could be to use local advertising alongside social media to receive discounts during face to face or phone advertising to show empathy to needs for the short term or long term (How much do celebrities and influencers get paid for social posts? - Our Social Times - Social Media for Business, 2020).<nl><nl>Sales Promotion Tool<nl><nl>Sales promotion offers an incentive to encourage target audiences with promotional messages to buy the product sooner than later (Fill and Turnbull, 2016). It creates a differentiated strategy, launching the new Enterprise CarClub at Aston University by offering value to customers through planning sales promotion to incentivise students. Upselling opportunities are created with a variety of packages, starting from £4.50, enhanced at £3.45hour and under 22s at £5.95hour plans.<nl><nl>Sales Promotion presents the entrance to a partnership endorsement by sponsoring our car rental service. A well-known Birmingham hip hop artist ‘Mist’ will be integrated, who possesses a following of 670,000 (Instagram.com, 2020). By working in collaboration, this will build brand credibility and make the brand stand out to the demographic at Aston. Consumers will recall and remember the promotion, bringing in targeted behavioural marketing. Therefore, the student’s interest is captured, making them feel more inclined to sign up for the subscription (The Pros and Cons of Celebrity Endorsements - Baer Performance Marketing, 2020).. This partnership will offer a promotional online code discount and print coupons associated with himself to pull in more consumers to use the service, working towards the goal of reaching 500 buyers by year-end. He is already proactive in supporting Birmingham to make the city a better place through his involvement in projects, he will be more inclined to partner at a lower price than expected by an influencer of his popularity. (Mist Interview: U.K. Star Talks Hometown of Birmingham &amp; U.S. Rap Influences| Billboard, 2020). <nl><nl>Endorser attributes tie in with the TEARS model of trustworthiness, relating to endorsement being someone who can be trusted, have respect and expertise in the brand, physical attractiveness with pride in his health. Coming from a disadvantaged background in Birmingham, then progressing resonates with the target audience as students use him as inspiration towards goals. To have someone who is not just someone with a conative but affective strategy too, makes consumers feel to act on the Enterprise CarClub through a use of display of emotion and care (The Five Components in the TEARS Model of Endorser Attributes T Trustworthiness | Course Hero, 2020).<nl><nl>Managerial accountability allows the results of sales promotion to be easily justified in comparison to advertising. This way the margin for error as a calculated number will help in realising if the chosen promotion is effective towards our target market (Fill and Turnbull, 2016; Difference between advertising and sales promotion, 2020). <nl><nl>Implementation plan demonstrating the relative scheduling of Marcom tool activity:<nl><figure><nl>Creating the Gantt chart has enabled the 12 months of promotion for Enterprise Car Club to be planned out month by month. It establishes clear objectives and timeframes for which each tool should be executed. Using the advertising tool helps build brand value and image by encouraging change in consumer behaviour. <nl>For the advertising tool, TV advertisements, billboards, and promotional products will use the pulsing marketing strategy. <nl><nl>These are scheduled as a continuous schedule lasting the whole year at a low level throughout, becoming heavier during the peak times for selling (Continuous Advertising Definition | Marketing Dictionary | MBA Skool-Study.Learn. Share., 2020). <nl><nl>The peak times here are September, to take advantage of the advertising opportunities during freshers when students are most interested. Also, from December to February, the advertising tool is being used alongside our sponsor Mist performing, allocated sufficiently before the event and after to keep the awareness going. <nl><nl>Viral marketing is a flighting strategy due to the one-month period it is allocated solely to throughout the year. Within the advertising tool, internetsocial media adverts will be the continuous marketing strategy, as they will be available and shown to customers throughout the whole year, unlike the other tasks within the tool (Flighting, 2020). <nl><nl>The sales promotion tool will make use of discountscoupons and loyalty schemes as a continuous marketing strategy. These methods will always be available to consumers, so they are reminded of the need for the services, regardless of sales performance at any given time of the year. The fresher’s fair, contests, exhibitions, and fairs will all be making use of the flighting strategy as the advertising will be run at certain planned times, then have a cessation period throughout the year<nl>(9 Benefits of Sales Promotions - Gary A. Sanchez, 2020).<nl><nl>Integration of marcoms <nl><nl>Our specific objective is to improve awareness of the Enterprise Car Club for the car rental service and to attain 500 (or more) student buyers of the service before year-end at Aston University to reach our precise objective. Advertising and sales promotion have been decided as the two main tools because of brand awareness it will provide the up and coming brand. Advertising is informing and reminding about the products and services and a form of mass communication and links to sales promotion goals to increase sales quickly using discounts for example. Considering the timeframe and the main aim to build awareness in the Aston student’s target market, these tools provide a gateway to pull in consumers through trailing the service and use of endorsements to capture loyal customers.", "nk you!

{"id": "53d3086f-0f16-494e-9ec0-f7cb12861926", "discourse_types": ["essay", "text_message"], "pair": ["The Covid-19 pandemic has led to the enforcement of drastic social distancing measures, which affect the ways in which students interact and socialise with one another. These measures conflict with the human instinct to connect with others, thus increasing social isolation and feelings of loneliness within students (Bavel, et al., 2020). This affects their wellbeing both directly, towards poor mental health and indirectly, as the underpinning reason behind the huge reduction in social interaction that students must now deal with (Burns, Dagnall, &amp; Holt, 2020). The objective of this research is to gain an insight into the importance of social interactions on the wellbeing of students, and how this has been impacted due to Covid-19. The main research question was therefore: ‘How have changes in the amount and quality of social interactions due to COVID-19 impacted the well-being of undergraduate students?’. Through this, a semi-structured interview was developed, which aimed to investigate the experience of changed social interactions, the impact this had on participant wellbeing, and their experience of coping mechanisms.<nl><nl>Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) as a suitable method<nl>Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) has been chosen as the most appropriate methodology for this research topic because it is concerned with the detailed examination of the participant’s personal lived experience (Willig &amp; Stainton Rogers, 2017).<nl>Analysis<nl>1 \"It’s overwhelming and draining\": negative impacts on wellbeing<nl>This superordinate theme explores the significant physical and psychological toll Covid-19 has taken on Feya, fostering a sense of powerlessness. She discusses the loss of control, predictability and security within her life during these unprecedented times.<nl>1.1 \"…I don’t see the light at the end of the tunnel\": depressive symptoms<nl>Here, Feya uses a metaphoric expression, of being in a tunnel with no light, to illustrate the sense of loss of control she feels over her life and the feeling that there is no way out of this ordeal. She sees no light, which otherwise symbolises hope, at the end of this dark, perpetual tunnel, that is her mind. This is further supplemented by her mention of feeling \"trapped\", which implies that she feels imprisoned by her own thoughts and is looking for an escape. Feya appears to be discontent with life and tired of \"staring at the same four walls everyday\". This is reiterated when she states that she is \"living the same day, every day\". She feels stuck, defeated and hopeless. This creates a powerful, cyclical imagery of her depressive thoughts as being inescapable, as she goes over the same worries over and over.<nl>\"…I feel really lonely, and a bit depressed and sluggish […] I feel like I’m locked in a box.\"<nl>Feya talks about the negative emotions felt amidst lockdown restrictions. The box Feya describes is a metaphorical representation of the confinements within her own mind, as well as the physical confinements within her home. She highlights being mentally drained and avidly waiting for lockdown to come to an end. Feya’s use of the phrase ‘mentally drained’ implies she is emotionally depleted and burnt-out due to the accumulation of stress in her personal life. In addition, Feya reiterates her fear of being ‘lonely\" later on, saying \"I feel like you have to go out and see people, otherwise […] you’ll drive yourself crazy\". This conveys her anxiety of being left alone to fight all of these overwhelming feelings by herself. The loneliness makes her feel vulnerable.<nl>Feya describes the bodily symptoms of depression, such as a loss of appetite and insomnia, which denotes how her feelings have clearly wreaked havoc on her physical wellbeing:<nl>\"When I’m drained, my appetite disappears, I can’t sleep and my mood’s just dull\"<nl>Feya describes the sudden, erratic nature of her sadness. The way her appetite ‘disappears’ without warning suggests that symptoms are unpredictable and out of her control. Her inability to sleep shows how overwhelming this experience is, as her mind is constantly racing with negative thoughts, to the extent where she feels disorientated. The use and repetition of the verb ‘drained’ connotes a powerful imagery of a pale, empty shell of a person, highlighting the invasive, destructive effects as a result of being in isolation.<nl>1.2 \"I’ve been so anxious about the future, because life as we know it, has changed\": anxious symptoms<nl>Within this superordinate theme, Feya alludes to her apprehensions about what the future holds post-pandemic. She is filled with apprehensions and worries. Feya talks about going through a \"really uncertain time\", most of which revolves around her professional and personal life. She expresses an unknowingness of \"all of this is going to be over\". The pronoun ‘all’ denotes that the current crisis has impacted every aspect of her life. It depicts the true extent of the impact of Covid-19. Feya expresses how powerless she feels:<nl>\"We can’t plan things out anymore\" <nl>Feya refers to the lack of control she feels, as her \"many plans and aspirations\" have been compromised. The use of the collective pronoun, ‘we’, denotes a sense of unity and acts as an attempt to regain a sense of control. It provides Feya with a sense of reassurance, that she is not the only one going through these hardships. She paints a picture of herself as being powerless, with no choice but to surrender to the virus. <nl>This is further exacerbated when Feya appears to be thinking out loud, searching for the answers to her many questions: \"Are we going back into lockdown, are we not, can we go into work, can we go to restaurants and see our friends?\" Feya is clearly stuck in her ruminations, which is an expression of her doubt and uncertainty regarding what the future holds.<nl>Feya describes the significant psychological distress she faced, induced by the abrupt nature of lockdown restrictions:<nl>\"I- I- I was really scared and cautious and careful\"<nl>The repetition of \"I\", where Feya appears to stumble over her words, sounds robotic and reflects how overwhelmed she felt at the time. There is a strong sense of fear and anxiety, depicted through her selection of words.<nl><nl>2 \"I felt so distant from them\": changes in social interactions<nl>This superordinate theme reflects the changes in Feya’s social habits and ways of social interaction. Feya describes feeling not only physically distant from her friends, but also emotionally. She complains about how they \"wouldn’t even be awake at the same time\", which creates a barrier that even digital interactions can’t overcome. She feels emotionally detached and isolated, indicating a clear disconnect with the outside world due to the Covid-19 crisis. This is further emphasised when Feya talks about losing the ability to socialise, saying she had \"forgot what it was like to even talk to friends\", which implies that being in social isolation had stifled her.<nl><nl>2.1 \"With your immediate family members who you’re living with, you get sick of and start bickering\": interpersonal tensions<nl>Here, Feya states how confinement with family members in her household has led to inevitable interpersonal tensions, as a result of stress and spending so much time together. The verb ‘bickering’ implies that they argue over trivial matters, which suggests that her ‘dull’ moods not only impact her own wellbeing but are also displaced onto others. <nl><nl>2.2 \"If it wasn’t for social platforms, I don’t know what I’d do\": shift from physical to digital communication<nl><tab>Feya describes social media as being an essential tool used to stay in contact with her friends and family. She explains that maintaining ties has \"moved from a physical form […] to a digital form\" and that everyone is just \"a call away\" now. <nl><tab>Though she expresses her gratitude for these platforms, she says it does not compare to face-to-face contact. This emphasises how important physical connection is to Feya – it’s a love language, which makes her feel ‘alive’ and connected.<nl><nl>3 \"I’m pretty distracted most of the time\": coping mechanisms amid pandemic<nl>The final superordinate theme portrays how Feya is coping with the pandemic. Feya talks about being a key-worker alongside a university student, so she feels that she hasn’t felt the impacts of the pandemic as severely as others. The adjective ‘distracted’ suggests she hasn’t truly dealt with the impacts of the pandemic, instead she has diverted her attention and energy towards studies and work to avoid reality.<nl><nl>3.1 \"I’ve just got to get on with it really\": acceptance<nl><tab>Here, Feya’s tone implies that she is ready to accept the uncontrollable nature of the Covid-19 virus and wants to proceed forward with her life, despite the turmoil it has caused. Acceptance is where the power lies, as Feya is able to find the control that she had previously lacked.<nl><nl>3.2 \"It’s enjoyable, it’s what life is about really\": maintaining close ties<nl>Here, Feya insinuates the importance of interpersonal connections through her use of language. She uses words which highlight the warmth that she feels in the company of her friends and describes how her mood ‘brightens up’ in their presence. She denotes the importance to continuously attend to and nurture her relationships in order to live a meaningful life.<nl>She talks about how seeing her friends has had a really positive impact on her mental health. She adds that she doesn’t feel \"as alone\" in their company, which shows how social interactions provide a sense of unity, ease and comfort. They provide her with reassurance that she’s not the only one going through these difficult times.<nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>Dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic has taken a toll on the social connectedness and wellbeing of Feya. She defines her experience of lockdown as being overwhelming, draining and uncertain, as a result of social distancing measures, university closures and reduced social contact. During the course of the interview, we see a shift from frustration to acceptance of the global pandemic, as she is forced to come to terms with reality.", "stem><new>cos it’s taking long to download it<new>oki<new>okay x<new>it’s okay babes don’t worry ab it, i’m home now otherwise i would’ve😩 xx<new>i’ll see you another time though whenever you’re freee<new>i’ll let you know once i have my schedule for next week cos i’ve got an assignment due this <day> xx<new>yeah omg i was gna ask you just now, leggoooo x<new>lemme see what parks are nice<new>is it called <location>?<new>which ones nicer<new>this one looks good<new>it’s got a biggg lake there i think<new>wait do u wanna get food first<new>shall i meet you in <town>"]}
{"id": "5eac13e8-e348-4fe9-aafa-f119810ae12d", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Subsequent to losing the 1983 election on a hardline socialist programme, it became clear that a rebranding of the Labour Party was crucial. The term \"New Labour\" was initially coined by Tony Blair at the 1994 Labour Party Conference, inspired by sociologist Anthony Giddens who believed that it was important to find a \"third way\" between Thatcherism and traditional socialism. The question in hand explores the way in which the Labour Party’s place on the political spectrum has changed through the complexities of several policies introduced over the years. In this essay, I will be assessing the extent to which the Labour Party has been redefined from the Blair-era over two decades ago, to Corbynism today. It is worthwhile dealing with the topic at hand as politics is a subject which needs to be continuously adapting to reflect changes in global dynamics, this topic in particular reveals how government policies develop to maintain dialogue and preserve stability in an increasingly fragile and threatened geopolitical system.<nl><nl>Blair’s creation of New Labour attempted to formulate an alternative to traditional social democracy and free-market neo-liberalism in the context of a modern globalised economy. This neo-revisionism advocated a balance of rights and responsibilities, resulting in communitarian liberalism which emphasised that personal autonomy operates within a communal context based on mutual dependence and benefit. As Brown’s government ensured no radical breakaway from New Labour, ideals and principles of the Labour Party remained the same for many years. However, it is important to note that the Labour government’s failures in the early 21st century appear to have fundamentally changed voters’ views on whether Labour can be trusted on the economy, leading to a Conservative victory in the 2010 general election. This is largely significant as throughout the recent years, the Labour Party seems to have adopted more socialist principles, evident in Corbyn’s left-wing agenda. Therefore, I aim to argue that the Labour party has evolved to a large extent over the years due to many successes and failures of the party leaders’ policies.<nl><nl>In this essay I have used a range of books, websites and JSTOR journals. Previously published academic works include New Labour Hard Labour? Restructuring and resistance in the welfare industry by Gerry Mooney and Alex Law, as well as books such as Leadership and the Labour Party by John Gaffney. In these sources, the key concepts are focussing on New Labours’ appeal to the masses and rebranding of the party. These journals and books gave clear statistics taking an innovative approach as well as differing opinions on the main policies which redefined the Labour Party which provided useful insight and information. To gain better understanding of the authors to ensure reliability of my resources I also did some prior research on them. There were many crossovers to other academic disciplines such as economics and history, especially when researching Blair and Brown’s economic policies there were many statistics and economic theory. However, there were also weaknesses in the sources I used such as the author’s personal opinion being a large influence.<nl><nl>After four general election defeats, the Labour Party realised that traditional class-based political ideas and concepts were no longer seen as acceptable by the British electorate. As a result, the New Labour governments aimed to differentiate themselves from earlier social democratic administrations, by conserving resources before investing more in key public services. Blair modernised the Labour party to appeal more to middle-class voters by moving away from traditional policies such as nationalisation and emphasising constitutional reform. ‘Clause IV’ of the party constitution was abandoned, ties with trade unions were loosened and the party moved away from its previously hard-left position. Labour also became more pro-European as the EU adopted policies that protected workers’ rights such as the Social Chapter, and the Third way brought market models to some government-run services and aroused interest across the western world. Labour policies were largely based around the free-market, which was accepted as the best form of wealth creation with further privatisation and reduced corporate taxes to encourage enterprise. Greater emphasis was placed on individualism and communitarianism with the belief that the individual should realise their own potential and that everyone has a responsibility to care for the community collectively. Moreover, \"as part of its wider reform of the welfare and modernisation agendas, New Labour [had] sought to emphasise the role and responsibilities of family and community in the provision of welfare services\" (Mooney, 2007). Here it is evident that the sole focus of neo-revisionism was essentially a Labour rebranding exercise to appeal to the masses and attract business interests following four consecutive UK general election defeats, it introduced important measures that promoted social justice and improved the position of the most disadvantaged in society. The government had aimed to differentiate themselves from earlier social democratic administrations and had done so very well.<nl><nl>This rebranded party proved to be largely successful for the first few years and the idea of the \"Third way\" appealed largely to the masses, however over time, Blair’s popularity began to decline. Although the Conservatives lost the 2001 election, they persisted in arguing that New Labour wasn’t delivering its policy promises. This began to prove effective as there was a significant fall in the number of people who expected service delivery to either get better or much better over the next few years as \"healthcare by September 2003 8 per cent fewer people expected the NHS to ‘get better’ over the following year. At the same time, the government’s satisfaction ratings fell sharply from a 54 per cent in September 2001, to 36 per cent in September 2002 and 25 per cent in September 2003\" (Hindmoor, 2005). There are many reasons as to why this happened, the main being the tragedy of Iraq which ensnared him so completely that by Summer of 2007 he had acknowledged he would be a liability in the campaign to keep Britain in the European Union. It is believed that \"Iraq [had] come to dominate the Blair legacy to such an extent that many of his notable achievements – the Good Friday agreement, devolution to Scotland and Wales, the minimum wage and a number of social reforms are doomed to shelter under its shadow\" (BBC News, 2019). As a combined result of the Blair–Brown pact, Iraq war and low approval ratings, pressure built up within the Labour Party for Blair to resign and Brown was chosen to replace him in an uncontested election.<nl><nl>The Financial crisis and recession of 2008-09 led to a minor shift in policy by the Brown government but still maintained a majority of the New Labour values and principles. Gordon Brown had primacy over vast areas of domestic policy and handled the banking collapse, as the unpopularity of the Iraq war had meant that a new focus was needed for the party. In its foreign policy choices, the Brown government was quite similar to that of Tony Blair’s as it \"displayed the same unshakeable Atlanticism, pronounced Euroscepticism, and commitment to increasing international aid to 0.7% of gross national income as its coalition successor\" (Lee, 2019). In both health and education, \"Brown continued the Blair governments’ pattern of top-down reorganisation of hospitals and schools, and the increasing use of private sector finance and organisations to deliver services\" (Lee, 2019). He supported increased spending on hospitals, pledged to make reform of the NHS a major priority and also promised to retain the public-sector reforms implemented by Blair. In domestic policy terms, the impact of devolution meant that the Brown government’s capacity to reform public services was confined to England, where Brown had no personal democratic mandate to intervene.<nl><nl>Although, Brown retained a vast majority of Blair’s policies, he set out plans to decentralise Britain and make good the more evident weaknesses of Blairism, not least its careless disregard for civil liberties. However, two developments quickly derailed the new prime minister’s hopes. In \"August 2007 the first cracks appeared in the international banking system, cracks that would lead to the run on the Northern Rock bank the first run on a bank in Britain for 150 years – and its eventual nationalisation by New Labour – an irony after years of pro-business rhetoric\" (White, 2019). After initial rises in opinion polls following Brown becoming Prime Minister, Labour's popularity declined with the onset of a recession in 2008 leading to poor results in the local and European elections in 2009. Brown had broken an earlier promise not to raise income tax levels by creating a new 50% band, to be paid by those who earned more than £150,000 a year which led to claims that New Labour ideology had been abandoned. <nl><nl>Despite a Conservative rule, Ed Miliband struggled to balance his more left-wing views with a desire to appeal to the centre ground. Under his leadership the Labour Party maintained some elements of New Labour policies, while shifting slightly to the left. The new leader called for the restoration of the 50 per cent top rate of income tax and the need to re-establish Labour’s reputation as a competent manager of the economy was an important concern for Miliband. He tried to combine New Labour’s support for business with the defence of the party’s core working-class constituency by drawing a distinction between what he called ‘predatory’ and ‘responsible capitalism. At the 2015 election Miliband pledged to reduce the deficit every year of the next parliament. He insisted that Labour’s spending plans would be paid for without additional borrowing. \"Miliband [pledged] to fund the NHS improvements with a mansion tax on properties worth over £2m. other tax pledges include the restoration of the 10p tax band for low earners\" (The Independent, 2019). However, by 2015 there was pressure from the left of the party for Labour to adopt a much more radical approach. Some party member attributed the landslide victory of the SNP in Scotland, where Labour was left with just one Westminster seat, to the party being insufficiently left wing.<nl><nl>\"Labour's manifesto is one of the most radical proposed overhauls of the way companies are owned and run in decades. It would mark the biggest ownership takeover by the state since the nationalisations that occurred after the outbreak of World War Two\" (BBC News, 2019). Jeremy Corbyn sinisterly told photographers and journalists \"under Socialism you will all cooperate\" (Express.co.uk, 2019) suggesting a radical shift to the left. He took the Miliband-balls idea of increased investment in the economy further, calling for large-scale funding of industry and infrastructure organised by a National Investment Bank. He called for the renationalisation of the railways, a policy the New Labour governments refused to adopt. Instinctively supporting intervention of an Old Labour kind, he demanded that companies publish pay audits with the aim of countering discrimination in the workplace. \"Labour has pledged to rejuvenate the UK's neglected high streets, nationalize public services and some major industries, and force all large firms to give their employees a share of the business and a voice on their boards. Critics of Labour say these policies are throwbacks to failed socialist governments of the 1970s\" (Vonberg, 2019). Like Miliband, he favoured the restoration of the 50 per cent top rate of income tax. However, Corbyn was much more clear-cut in his competition to austerity, characterising it as a political choice that harmed the most vulnerable members of society, rather than an economic necessity. Many bold claims have been made about Corbyn with \"Corbyn may not be a Communist, but he’s certainly a Marxist\" (The Northern Echo, 2019) being one of the boldest. Corbyn strongly opposed benefit cuts and a socialist he regarded the poor as the victims of capitalism, who are entitled to public support. He opposed the use of the private sector to deliver public services – a central aspect of New Labour. Thus, he argued for a wholly state-run NHS. In order to promote lifelong education and training, he called for a national education service, and opposed student tuition fees. By contrast, Ed Miliband had confined himself to advocating their reduction from £9,000 to £6,000 a year. In terms of law and order policy, Corbyn was opposed to the more hard-line policies of the New Labour era, such as increased powers to combat terrorism and the introduction of identity cards. This became a less controversial policy area within the labour party – both Blairites and Corbynites found common ground in opposing government cuts to police number. Corbyn consistently voted against the use of force and favoured the withdrawal of the UK from NATO’s military structure and the abolition of the Trident nuclear weapons system, again placing him at odds with New Labour. `He followed the mainstream of his party in supporting continued British membership of the EU, emphasising its positive role in protecting workers’ rights.<nl><nl>In conclusion, it is evident that the Labour Party had been redefined to a large extent, beginning as a more centrist party in 1997 and eventually becoming a more radical socialist party in present day. Through several policy failures, the Labour Party established that it needed to rebrand itself once again to adapt to current affairs. It is evident that Gordon Brown maintained a large amount of the New Labour principles however, Ed Miliband realised that this new and reformed party wasn’t going to get them through the 2015 election. This resulted in more left-wing agendas being proposed and the Labour Party promoting themselves as a more socialist organisation.

{"id": "a08e242d-7231-4cad-b576-7faa492261e6", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Introduction<nl>After winning a costa first novel award, The Shock of the Fall by Nathan Filer (2013) became a piece of popular fiction, inviting a broad range of readers. However, it’s brutal depiction of mental illness means there are differing responses to the text. ‘Reader response data’ has become a popular way for researchers to identify how a reader places themselves in relation to a text through assessing their responses to said text. <nl>This study will assess how reviews from the open access website ‘Good Reads’ align themselves to The Shock of the Fall’s protagonist and overall narrative. Oatley’s (1999) theory of \"identification\" or \"observer\" will be drawn upon for this purpose, as well as Stockwell’s (2009) discussion of reading metaphors, so that commonalities can emerge to determine factors that cause alignment with the text. To compliment these theories, language analysis more generally will be utilised in order to collectively lead to an understanding of reader positioning within the data sets.<nl><nl>Literature Review<nl>The Shock of the Fall by Nathan Filer is a piece of experimental fiction portraying the deteriorating mind of the protagonist, Matthew. McCarthy-Jones (2018) praises Filer for his \"beautiful\" form and word choice, whilst Armstrong (2014, 173) highlights the brilliant use of \"complex narrative structure\" and experimental use of \"graphics and fonts\". Moreover, Armstrong argues that the novel is brilliant both in its insightful portrayal of the family bond, but also in its depictions of mental health. Similarly, Rajasingam (2014) believes the novel depicts the inpatient experience with such accuracy that it could be beneficial for junior doctors to understand the bleak realities of these unique situations. This accurate depiction is most likely down to Filer’s personal experience as a psychiatric nurse (Sanai 2014), as he was seemingly able to amalgamate his previous experience to create the protagonist, Matthew.<nl>This study utilises reader response data. Reader response data is seen as a \"rigorous and evidence based\" approach to understanding reader interactions with a text (Whiteley and Canning 2017). Fish (1970) discusses how a text comes into being through reader interaction. Therefore, reader response data allows us to seek, understand and interpret reader’s interactions with certain texts through different means, which is why it is utilised within this research to determine factors of alignment within reader reviews. <nl>The basis of this research surrounds Oatley’s (1995;1999) theory discussing alignment with a text. Oatley (1999) argues there are two positions a reader adopts; \"identification\" or \"observer\". He believes that the observer is a spectator role, in which we are an objective outsider in a narrative, whereas identification occurs when a reader aligns themselves with the protagonist, taking on their goals and emotions. Moreover, he argues that a first-person narrative favours identification, whereas third-person narratives favour the spectatorobserver role. Identification is therefore seen as an intense alignment with the protagonist, with Oatley stating we \"become that person\" in the narrative (Oatley 1999, 446), made ever more present if the reader can sympathise with the protagonist through personal experience (Oatley 1995). However, it is important to note that these alignments are part of a scale where readers have autonomy, as opposed to having a fixed state in one position.  <nl>To analyse the position of identification or observer, one of the methods I will be using is metaphor analysis. Lakoff and Johnson’s (1980) ‘conceptual metaphor theory’ highlights how we better understand an entity when it is described in relation to another. It shows how metaphors can be \"extended\", allowing us to map the meaning within a metaphor in order to gauge the full detail of the comparison. Dirven et al (2003) highlight the significance of the theory, arguing conceptual metaphor theory ignited the importance of metaphor for our understanding of knowledge. Metaphors are useful in conjunction with noticing the identifierobserver role, as the way a reader discusses their experience of reading is often linked to their level of submersion and alignment with the protagonist and the text. <nl>Stockwell (2009) and Gerrig (1993) discuss metaphors more centred around reading. Stockwell (extending knowledge outlined by Gerrig) discusses metaphors that can be used by readers to describe their reading experience. These include \"reading is a journey\", \"reading as transport\" and \"reading as control\" (Stockwell 2009, 80-81). Stockwell (2005, 144) believes critical theorists should \"engage with the texture of the text\", which allows us to read as one does when they are simply reading for enjoyment; a \"natural reader\". With ‘Good Reads’ being a platform for mostly natural readers, we can see how utilising this method will allow inferences for reader position to emerge, as the reviewers discuss their experiences in a natural way, therefore giving their natural alignment with the text. <nl>I will also be drawing on conceptions of ‘stake inoculation’ and ‘category entitlement’ within my analysis. Stake inoculation can be identified when a reader is not presenting a vested interest in a text, and has been described as readers wanting to be \"regarded as considered, reasoned and neutral\" (Peplow 2011, 306). Category entitlement, however, is defined as when certain people in specific situations are given authority for their knowledge in a specific area (Potter 1996). These features can be linked to the need to keep a \"positive face\" that is protected and maintained with the social space (Potter 1996; Goffman 1967). Reviewers may use stake inoculation andor category entitlement in order to portray themselves in a positive light for other reviewers, especially because the site is seen as a \"social network for book reviews\" (Fay 2012). <nl><nl>Methodology<nl>I began my naturalistic study by sourcing reviews from the open access website ‘Good Reads’; a book reviewing website. This website was useful as it allows users to interact with reviews through ‘likes’, as well as having a rating system (one to five stars) to review the book discussed. As a result, I was able to find the most ‘liked’ reviews within each rating category. By choosing the most ‘liked’ reviews, the assumption can be made that the views described within the review reflect the majority, as they were the most widely interacted with. <nl>After selecting the most liked review from each rating category, I anonymised each review, by naming them R1 (being the review with a one-star rating) to R5 (being the review with a five-star rating), ensuring no ethical issues in relation to confidentiality could occur (See Appendix for full reviews). I then used ‘NVivo’; a form of qualitative data analysis software, to begin my analysis. I ‘coded’ each review in NVivo, which then highlighted areas where there were common themes among each review. This allowed me to make inferences as to the common themes that link to identificationobservation (Oatley 1999) within each of the rating categories. <nl><nl>Analysis<nl>Comparing uses of Category Entitlement:<nl>One of the most common themes across all of the reviews is category entitlement. All of the reviewers, in one way or another, highlighted their authority within their review. The interesting part about comparing the uses of category entitlement is the difference in tone that occurs depending on how positive or negative the review is. The more negative reviews use this device in order to depict how The Shock of The Fall was a bad novel, because they identified better with certain other novels (R1 and R2). Whereas, the more positive reviews show their identification with The Shock of The Fall by providing examples of other mental health literature that has also made them feel this way (R3, R4 and R5). For example, R5 states they have read \"a number of books regarding mental illness\", but describes this text as \"purely unique\". On the other hand, R1 argues \"I would never recommend this book considering the wealth of options available to readers […]\". Peplow et al (2015, 75) discuss how you can put yourself forward as having \"expert knowledge\", which can be seen through the intentional discussion of broader knowledge. However, they also discuss how readers can \"play down\" their entitlement, which is also present through the subtle portrayals of wider reading as opposed to more direct mentions of expert knowledge (Peplow et al 2015, 74). As ‘Good Reads’ is a platform that invites avid readers, one could argue that a participant of the site would likely house a level of category entitlement simply due to this fact, and therefore their broad knowledge of literature would most likely be conveyed within their reviews, intentionally or not. Moreover, the fact that the website has open access means some reviewers may want to portray, and maintain, a ‘positive face’ (Potter 1996; Goffman 1967), which can be achieved through the use of category entitlement. Therefore, the comparative aspect category entitlement allows the users to present their identificationobservation with the text.<nl>Although in another breadth of mental illness, a study into the effects of reading novels about eating disorders showed participants felt their mood and self-confidence diminished, whilst other genres improved their mood (Troscianko 2018). Despite being about a very different aspect of mental health, I believe these findings highlight how the genre one chooses to focus on can have such ingrained effects on themselves as a reader. In a similar way to Oatley’s (1995) statement about how a reader identifies more intensely if they can empathise with a reader from their personal experience, you could argue that reading fiction of this genre highlights how different forms of mental health literature ignite different reactions for certain individuals. Where the more positive reviews name novels that depict mental health in a way that has \"fascinated\" them (R4) and highlight their appreciation for such literature (R5, R3), the more negative reviews could arguably be having a similar reaction to that laid out in the study mentioned (Troscianko 2018) through their preference of other mental health literature (R2), therefore showing the use of comparison to determine alignment with the text. As the readers all portray themselves to have a broad knowledge of literature, we can see how a novel of such unique nature could create conflicting responses depending on the reviewers individual understanding and perceptions of mental health literature more generally. Therefore, we can see that all of the reviews utilise category entitlement as a device to compare The Shock of the Fall to other texts of a similar vein, which therefore portrays their level of observationidentification depending on how they ‘rank’ this text compared to others they discuss. <nl>Emotive vs Clinical Language – Comparing uses of Reading Metaphors and Stake Inoculation:<nl>Reading metaphors (Stockwell 2009; Gerrig 1993) are an insightful way to decipher the identificationobserver positioning. Stockwell (2009,80) identifies a number of metaphors commonly used by readers; reading is \"transport\", reading is \"control\", and reading is \"investment\". As these responses can be aligned more directly with an investment with the reading material, it isn’t entirely unsurprising that the two top rated reviews are the only reviews which give examples of this use of metaphor. The more positive reviews actively present themselves as having an identification stance through their use of reading metaphors. R5 described being \"grabbed\" and \"held\" by the book, providing an example of the \"reading as control\" metaphor that Stockwell (2009, 80) discusses. As this is the most highly rated review, which speaks very positively about the novel as a whole, is it not surprising that the reader feels so invested in the narrative. However, despite R4 being mostly positive, the metaphors used within their review do not reflect their identification in the same way. R4 utilises \"reading as transport\" (Stockwell 2009, 80) through feelings of being lost in the narrative; \"at times you have to try and remember where you are\", as well as describing the narrative as \"following\" the narrator. Here, the use of metaphor seems to have less intensity; they are not being controlled in the same sense that R5 describes. However, there is still a clear alignment presented, as the reviewer is situated within the narrative for the feeling of being \"lost\" to occur. Although \"following\" for R4 is not as intense of a description as \"grabbed\" and \"held\" in R5, we can see that there is still a level of alignment that is arguably understandable from their different review ratings (as R4 rated the novel slightly lower than R5). Their difference also highlights Oatley’s argument that aligning with a text is part of a scale, therefore R4 simply isn’t as far on the ‘identification scale’ as R5. Therefore, we can see that the use of metaphor for the more positive reviews shows the level of identification that the readers feel through their embodiment of the text. <nl>On the other hand, it is interesting how some of the negative reviews use stake inoculation, which directly contrasts the intense feeling described by the reading metaphors portrayed in the positive reviews. Where the positive reviewers use metaphor in order to portray an alignment with the text, R3 and R2 speak about the same harrowing events within the novel, yet do not use the same language to describe the experience. R2 states very blatantly \"Matt is haunted by his dead brother\", whilst R3 states \"This is an interesting read that deals with mental illness, more particularly schizophrenia, as a result of a boy’s grief over the death of his older brother.\". Where other more positive reviews have discussed the physical grip and transportation that the portrayal of the protagonist’s mental health had on them, we can see with R2 and R3 that there is a very clinical, blunt approach to discussing the topic. Stake inoculation is about a portrayal of being \"considered, reasoned and neutral\" (Peplow 2011, 306), which, when discussing mental health, shows why some who wish to portray themselves in this way would use such clinical language to describe the text. Peplow (2011) discusses how a reader’s positive face can be at risk if they engage in explaining their personal interpretation of a text due to judgement from other readers, therefore this could indicate why some of the reviewers, on a site that is based so largely on user interaction, could use stake inoculation as a means to deter this judgement. <nl>The stark comparison between the positive and negative reviews shows how having an identification stance clearly impacts your perception of a text, as those that do identify describe their reading experience with so much more intensity. On the other hand, the clinical approach of the negative reviews highlights that they simply observed the events without gaining any form of attachment to the protagonist or his struggles, giving a fairly alternate reading experience. <nl>Perceptions of Accuracy:<nl>The majority of the reviews comment on Filer’s accurate depiction of mental health within the novel, arguing his background as a psychiatric nurse enhanced his ability to portray expert knowledge on the topic. Therefore, we can see, even within the negative reviews, one of the main praises is through this depiction of accuracy. However, the important distinction between the positive and negative reviews, despite all of them praising the accurate depiction, is that some reviews can empathise with the accurate depiction, whereas others can simply appreciate. The most negative review, R1, states their appreciation for the accuracy very blatantly; \"…it presents a very realistic glimpse of what mental illness looks and feels like\". Here we see no language that attaches the reader to the narrative; they are embodying the essence of an observer role. R2 is less clinical in language, yet still places themselves outside of the story world; \"You do get a very strong sense of the mental bind that some patients… get into once they’re sucked into the mental health biz…\". R2 is very informal throughout, therefore their discussion of the accuracy continues this informal language to convey their observer position. This review uses emotive language to describe the actual events of the novel (\"mental bind\", \"sucked into\"), but this language is solely attached to the narrative and not their emotions in relation to said narrative. Similar to the use of stake inoculation discussed previously, the clinical language is used within the more negative reviews as a means to distance themselves from the narrative. Therefore, we can see that again, with such a sensitive topic, the clinical language allows these reviewers to avoid being seen as prejudice (Peplow 2011) by simply outlining events as opposed to exposing their own opinions of said events.<nl>On the other hand, with the more positive reviews, the accuracy only seemed to add to their levels of identification. R5 states \"He [Filer] does not idealise the staff or the patients, both of them have good days and bad days and this was remarkably refreshing.\". Moreover, R3 states \"It is a daring but successful endeavour on the part of the author to unravel the tangled world a person with schizophrenia lives in.\". Here, we can see that identificationobservation is part of a scale, as both the most highly rated review and the neutral review use emotive language which signifies identification. R3’s use of emotive language (\"daring\", \"unravel\", \"tangled\") in isolation invite the assumption of heightened identification, but when we assess within the entire review, this isn’t the case. Whereas R5 discusses the accuracy in the expected manner due to their consistent identification. Oatley (1999) believes first-person narratives invite more of an \"identification\" role, which is reflected within these reviews. Those that do identify can be seen to enter the story world and therefore take on the emotions of the protagonist, meaning the accurate depiction seemingly made this embodiment even more intense. Moreover, Oatley (1995) argues that emotions arise whenif a reader can empathise with the story characters and their struggles, particularly from personal experience, which could indicate why some reviews discuss the text with such identification; if a reader has had personal experiences that are similar to the protagonist, they may be able to identify more heavily than someone who cannot relate in the same way. <nl>When we assess the discussion of accuracy from all of the reviewers, we can see that accuracy as a feature within a novel does not create a heightened level of observation or identification, but instead can be analysed as a discussion point to assess the position of observationidentification. In other words, in some cases it is important to see how readers discuss aspects of a text, as opposed to the specific aspect itself. With this example, language analysis is the focal device to understand the identificationobserver role, as well as highlighting how alignment with a text causes fairly distinctive differences in perceptions of key themes. <nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>Despite using a small data set, I believe there is clear evidence about the factors that indicate the identificationobserver role in relation to The Shock of the Fall, and therefore the aim of this research has been met. It emerged that the positive reviews had identification with the text (seen through emotive language and use of metaphor), and the negative reviews were more observational (seen through stake inoculation and clinical language). However, the slight inconsistencies of these patterns highlight Oatley’s argument that identificationobservation is part of a scale as opposed to two polarised positions. Should this research be extended with a larger data set, I believe more evidence would arise to reflect this scale, and present that not all negative reviews are entirely observational, and not all positive reviews show identification. <nl>It seems the best device to assess the identificationobservation within the reviews was language analysis. The comparison between the different reviews showed that it isn’t necessarily the presence of certain linguistic factors (for example category entitlement), but the discussion of such that show reader positioning; language analysis shows the device as an entity does not lead to an understanding of reader position, but the way it is utilised does. <nl>", "r <addr11_FN>,<nl><nl>I hope you are well.

Alpha activity at the left parietal lobe (P3) was higher 200ms before stimulus onset when the stimulus was cued to the left compared to the right. This supports Klimesch’s (2007) alpha inhibition hypothesis, stating that high alpha activity indicates inhibition in task-irrelevant brain regions. This finding paves way to further research on the implications of alpha activity and its relation to anticipatory attention. <nl><nl>Introduction<nl>Alpha oscillations (8-13Hz) have an inhibitory function and are involved in attentional selection and suppression (Klimesch, 2012). The alpha inhibition hypothesis (AIH) (Klimesch et al., 2007) highlights that high alpha activity indicates inhibition of task-irrelevant brain regions. Alpha activity is modulated by attention, as when stimuli are presented on a screen, contralateral brain areas are activated and ipsilateral are inhibited (task irrelevant).<nl>Mazahari et al.’s (2014) cued flanker task involved typically developing (TD), combined subtype, and inattentive ADHD participants. Null or response preparation (RP) cues preceded each trial, with an 84% accuracy of the correct direction to attend. The AIH was demonstrated as TD adolescents showed the greatest alpha suppression following the RP cues, with inattentive ADHD subtypes showing the least, due to their difficulty responding to environmental cues. Greatest alpha suppression was detected directly after cue onset for the TD group, with no group difference in alpha suppression following a null cue, suggesting that RP cues influence the lateralisation of processing.<nl>Sauseng et al.’s (2005) cued visual attention task involved a central arrow indicating which hemifield, a 50% chance of being cued left or right, the participants should attend to. The target stimulus was then presented, and participants were asked whether the bar was small or large (50% chance of each). Congruent trials included an instructional cue which was consistent with the location of the bar (75% of trials), and 25% of trials incongruent.<nl>Congruent trials showed stronger alpha suppression on sides contralateral to the hemifield where the stimuli were processed, derived from EEG recordings of the parietal, frontal, and fronto-medial regions, further supporting the AIH. Incongruent trials had an opposite effect due to incorrect anticipation of the stimulus. Fronto-medial and parietal regions demonstrated phase coupling between the RP cue and stimulus onset, and post-stimulus (200-600ms). <nl>Previous research shows alpha activity increases on the contralateral side to the stimuli attended, being most prominent in parietal and occipital regions before stimulus onset. The current study partially replicates Sauseng et al.’s (2005) cued visual attention task, hypothesising an increased alpha activity in the left parietal lobe (P3) when stimuli are presented on the left hemifield compared to the right, before target stimuli are presented for congruent trials.  <nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants<nl>39 psychology undergraduate students were selected via opportunity sampling, but one participant’s data was excluded as data was only available for one condition of the experiment.<nl><nl>Design<nl>A repeated measures design consisted of the independent variable (cue location) with two levels: left or right hemifield, and the dependent variable (the alpha amplitudes of the P3 electrode in 𝜇V (microvolts)). <nl><nl>Materials<tab><nl>The active EEG electrode was used to record alpha activity, the reference electrode provided a comparison and the earth electrode reduced interference, all connected to Biopac MP36 for data collection. Everi cream removed dead skin from the scalp, and AC cream adhered the electrode to the scalp, improving conductivity. Psychopy presented stimuli and sent event markers to Biopac through a Stimtracker device. The stimuli were two arrow cues (&lt; and &gt;), and two bars (Figure 1).<nl><figure><nl><nl>Procedure<nl>Alpha band oscillations (8–13Hz) were identified in the raw EEG data recorded (0.5-35Hz) with a sampling rate of 1000Hz. The 1020 system (Trans-Cranial Technologies, 2012) was employed, wherein the active electrode was attached to P3, reference to Fz, and earth to the forehead near the hairline. An impedance reading &lt;10kΩ was required prior to data collection, after which eligible participants were provided the right to withdraw and informed consent retrieved.<nl>Participants engaged in a practice trial, which began with instructions stating a cue would appear on the screen informing them which side to anticipate a stimulus, followed by a brief pause and either a small or large bar appearing on the appropriate side of the screen. Participants were then instructed to press ‘L’ if a large or ‘S’ if a small bar appeared on the screen. The cue (&lt; or &gt;) was displayed for 35ms, followed by a fixation cross to recapture participants’ attention to the centre of the screen, and then a small or large bar appearing on the specific hemifield for 50ms. Feedback was provided after each trial, with an interstimulus interval (ISI) of 800ms and 12 trials in total in the practice run. The practice run involved 4 trial types (arrow right to either small or large bar, and arrow left to either small or large bar) each repeating 3 times. The practice run involved only congruent trials; arrows pointed to the hemifield where the stimulus was presented.<nl>After completing the practice trials, participants were introduced to the experimental trials and recording of EEG alpha activity commenced. Experimental trials differed as no feedback was provided after trials, the ISI was between 200-1200ms, 25% of the trials were incongruent (stimulus was presented in the opposite side that the cue pointed to) and 75% congruent. Event markers were sent at stimulus onset, and each trial type was repeated 20 times in a randomised order (80 trials in total), wherein 50% of trials cued left and 50% right.<nl>Upon completion, the electrodes were removed, gel cleaned from the scalp and participants were debriefed.<nl><nl>Results<nl>Data Treatment<nl>Event markers were used to identify stimulus onset. Alpha activity was investigated after display of arrow cues and 200ms before stimulus onset.  The data was rectified to convert negative values into positive, showing the average signal strength (𝜇V) compared to the range, regardless of activity being inhibitory or excitatory. Data was averaged over 50 samples to reduce the effects of outliers. Rectification and integration ensured that accurate means were taken for each condition. These rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA) were used for further analysis. <nl>A Wilcoxon signed rank test was applied as the normality of data assumption for Shapiro-Wilk’s test was violated (p &lt; .05).<nl>Table 1. <nl>Median and interquartile ranges for alpha amplitudes in left parietal lobe in cued left and cued right conditions (n=38).<nl><nl><table><nl><nl>Table 1. shows median RAAA in P3 was greater in the cue left compared to cue right condition 200ms before stimulus onset, and a Wilcoxon signed rank test shows this difference was significant (W=566, n=38, p =.005).<nl><nl>Discussion<nl>200ms prior to stimulus onset, RAAA increased at P3 when participants were cued to the left compared to the right hemifield, supporting the research hypothesis. Stimuli presented on the left hemifield led to an increase in alpha activity on the left hemisphere due to inhibition as this region is task-irrelevant, and stimuli processed on the contralateral hemisphere led to increased alpha activity at P3. The findings support both the AIH and Sauseng et al.’s (2005) findings, showing an increase in alpha activity in task-irrelevant regions prior to stimulus presentation. This is because RP cueing affects the lateralisation of processing, leading to the anticipation of stimuli appearing on the same hemifield the cue directed them to.<nl>A methodological flaw is that high impedance affects data quality as it leads to variance in the measurements and requires more trials to ensure statistical significance in analyses of P3 (Kappenman and Luck, 2010). This can be mitigated by high pass filtering and artifact rejection, along with using a cool dry recording environment.<nl>The findings of this study lend weight to Klimesch’s (2007) AIH, and the influence of attention on alpha brain activity. Future research should explore specific types of attention e.g., anticipatory and temporal, and their influence on alpha activity.", "<addr6_NN>,<nl><nl>Apologies for the late response, I just wanted to say a massive thank you for helping me out.

{"id": "ff68d505-a3b9-44e3-a88c-21ccf164b7cc", "discourse_types": ["essay", "text_message"], "pair": ["Abstract:<nl>A prevalent association has been found between conscientiousness and favourable eating behaviour. Costa &amp; McRae (1992) define individuals high in conscientiousness as careful and self-disciplined. These characteristics are advantageous towards diet control and avoiding unhealthy eating. Another association exists between neuroticism and unfavourable eating behaviour (UEB): individuals high in neuroticism lack self-control and are vulnerable to unhealthy eating and disordered eating. This study used a questionnaire to measure the relationship between eating behaviour and personality type. Using correlational analysis, associations were found between unhealthy eating and personality traits, specifically conscientiousness being significantly negatively correlated with UEB and a predictor for UEB.<nl>Introduction:<nl>The World Health Organisation (2020) found that worldwide prevalence of obesity almost tripled between 1975 – 2016. Amongst others, obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases have been linked to psychological mechanisms. Namely, personality, acting as a risk factor for unfavourable eating behaviour (UEB), such as consumption of convenience junk food and sugary foods, all playing a role in increasing likelihood of illness. Costa &amp; McRae, (1992) aimed to represent human personality via the Big-Five Model comprising neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness and conscientiousness (OCEAN). Typically, an individual high in neuroticism exhibits emotional instability, moodiness and anxiety, placing them at high vulnerability for UEB including emotional eating and binge-eating. By contrast, an individual high in conscientiousness has good impulse control, goal-directed behaviours, restrained eating behaviours and dietary moderation. Keller &amp; Siegrist, (2015) assessed the connection between personality and UEB using the Big-Five Model and found conscientiousness had a significant negative indirect effect on consumption of food categories indicative of an unbalanced diet, such as fatty and sugary foods, whereas high neuroticism had a significant positive indirect effect on consumption of unhealthy food groups, making conscientiousness and neuroticism likely predictors of the food choices an individual makes. Personality type may predispose individuals to developing obesity and disease; investigating this association between personality and UEB is important, and is useful in indicating vulnerable individuals to introduce preventative methods in order to reduce disease and obesity in the population.<nl><nl>The following study used items from the Food Frequency Questionnaire (Hartmann et al., 2012) and the Big-Five Inventory scale (John &amp; Srivastava, 1999) to create a questionnaire which measured participants’ eating behaviours and personality types. It was hypothesized personality would be associated with FFQ score, specifically neuroticism would be positively correlated with FFQ score, and conscientiousness would be negatively correlated with FFQ score and act as a predictor of UEB.<nl><nl>Methods:<nl>Participants:<nl>195 participants, male (n= 135) and female (n= 60), aged 15 – 73 years old. A chain-referral sampling technique was used: participants completed the questionnaire, then recruited further participants to complete the questionnaire. <nl><nl>Design: <nl>Correlational design measuring the relationship between FFQ score and personality, the predictor variables being OCEAN traits.<nl><nl>Materials:<nl>Big Five Inventory (BFI):<nl>Measured personality traits: included 44 items grouped onto 5 subscales (OCEAN traits). Items were measured on a Likert scale 1-5 (see Appendix A for item scales). Negatively worded items were reverse coded: where participants marked their answer as 1, this was reverse coded to 5, 2 to 4, and so on. This was done to ensure reliability and validity by producing accurate responses. <nl><nl>Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ):<nl>Estimated habitual consumption frequency of various food products and snacks: included 17 items and 6 subscales (4 were included in analysis: sweets and savouries, sugar sweetened-beverages, convenience food and meat). Items regarding sweets and savouries, sugar-sweetened beverages and meat consumption frequency were assessed on a 6-point Likert scale 0-14: 14 = ‘several times a day’, 7 = ‘daily’, 3 = ‘several times per week’, 0.75 = ‘several times per month’, 0 =, ‘several times per year’ and ‘less or never’. Convenience food consumption was assessed on a 5- point Likert scale 0-7: 7 = ‘daily’, 3 = ‘several times per week’, 0.75 = ‘several times per month’, 0 = ‘several times per year’ and ‘less or never’ (see Appendix B for food groups and items). <nl><nl>Procedure: <nl>A questionnaire was created using items from the BFI the FFQ, and sent to participants via an online website. Participants were reminded their data was anonymous and informed consent was obtained. Once questionnaire responses were gathered, participants were debriefed and a raw data set was retrieved. Scores were calculated from the BFI as mean score by reverse coding, totalling scores from each trait and dividing them by number of items for a given trait, giving five mean scores. FFQ scores were calculated as total score by summing values of the 4 relevant subscales, giving a total of 0-182. Scores from the questionnaire as well as demographic data were exported to jamovi (The jamovi project, 2021) for analysis. <nl><nl>Results:<nl><table><nl>Table 1 shows agreeableness had the highest mean of the OCEAN traits (M = 3.68), and neuroticism had the lowest mean (M = 3.21). Table 2 shows results of the Pearson correlation, indicating there was a significant negative association between conscientiousness and FFQ score, (r (195) = -.168, p = .019), and a significant negative association between age and FFQ score, (r (195) = -.243, p = &lt;.001). There was a positive significant association between conscientiousness and agreeableness, (r (195) = .275, p = .004), and a positive association between conscientiousness and extraversion, (r (195) = .147, p = .041). Table 3 shows results of the multiple linear regression, indicating there was an overall significant effect between FFQ score and OCEAN traits, (F (7, 187) = 2.68, p &lt; .011, R2 = .091). Examining individual personality covariates indicated that conscientiousness (t = -2.029, p = .044) was a significant predictor in the model.  <nl><nl>Discussion:<nl>Conscientiousness was significantly negatively correlated with FFQ score, meaning as participants scored high on conscientiousness, they scored lower for UEB. Conscientiousness was found to be a significant predictor of FFQ score; these findings support the hypothesis and align with Costa &amp; McRae’s, (1992) findings that conscientiousness had a significant negative indirect effect on UEB. A well-established characteristic of conscientiousness is self-control, or in a psychological context, inhibitory control, described by Dyer, (2017) as the \"ability to supress one response in favour of a goal- directed response\" and that it \"plays an important role in emotional regulation\", particularly in prefrontal and cingulate cortex brain regions. Conscientious individuals are careful with their food behaviours and less likely to make poor food choices impulsively because they have better inhibitory control than say, individuals high in neuroticism. Being goal-driven and good at adhering to diets or weight-loss goals may explain why conscientiousness was negatively associated with favourable eating behaviours, like restriction of savoury foods and snacks; perhaps conscientiousness serves as a prevention of obesity and disease. <nl><nl>Agreeableness and extraversion were significantly positively correlated with conscientiousness. Individuals high in these traits are sociable, creative and emotionally stable. It is logical characteristics of conscientiousness correlate with those of agreeableness and openness, explaining why these traits were significantly correlated with one-another. Keller and Seigrist, (2015) found agreeableness was significantly negatively associated with sweetened drinks and meat consumption, and openness was significantly positively correlated with intake of fruits and vegetables. Thus, like conscientiousness, individuals high in agreeableness and extraversion are more likely to partake in healthy eating behaviours.<nl><nl>Interestingly, neuroticism was not significant, highlighting potential issues with the questionnaire’s validity, specifically whether items claiming to measure neuroticism were actually doing so. Moreover, the Five-Factor Model is limited – OCEAN traits are broad descriptions, rather than explanations of the ‘why’ or ‘how’s’ of personality. Categorisation of OCEAN traits ignore individual differences and the complexity of human personality. Consequently, can OCEAN traits be satisfactorily used to derive causalities between personality type and eating behaviour? Bogg &amp; Roberts, (2004) defend the need for a meta-analytic approach when examining personality and eating behaviour; by collating studies from diverse areas of research, causalities found between personality type and eating behaviour are considerably more valid, increasing generalisability of relationships established.", "e so xx<new>What’s your work number<new>Desk number even<new>Need to call u<new>Can I add Greek yogurt and strawberries to the shopping list please - hope this doesn’t wake you I just know you’re going early xx<new>Okay x<new>I’m literally just getting dressed brushing my teeth and coming down x<new>Why what’s carer done?<new>And what time?<new>2,2,2 please xx<new>Could you please bring me some plastic wallets home xx<new>Like 10-20?

Hotel U14 Autograph Collection (Unioninkatu 14) - this offers a room with an extra large double bed within a mile from the city centre and 0.8 miles of the beach for £308 (for both nights). This hotel looks very contemporary and also benefits from facilities including fitness centre and a restaurant. 2. Forenom Serviced Apartments (Kristianinkatu 11-13) - this offers a studio with two twin beds within a mile of the city centre and near the water also for £250 (for both nights). This option appears significantly more basic but would offer more independence as is self accommodating if that is what you wish for. - My research shows the Cafeteria Roastery (Runeberginkatu 31) to be the top rated breakfast cafe in the city centre so this would be my recommendation for breakfast. However, if staying at Hotel U14, there is an option to add breakfast for an extra £16 per night (totalling £342). - With regards to leisure activities for you to do in your free time during the trip, there is the Helsinki City Museum (Aleksanterinkatu 16) where you could get an insight into the history of the city, as well as the Apollo Live Club (Mannerheimintie 16) which has live music and comedic acts on Fridays and Saturdays. Both of which are reasonably priced and align with your interests. - There are countless restaurants in the city centre which would offer a variety of traditional cuisine (not involving sea food), though my recommendation would be Ravintola (Kasarmikatu 26) as this appears to offer a combination of fine dining with the traditional cuisine. - Finally there are a couple of large souvenir shops in the centre which would be perfect for you to get your children Finish souvenirs. My recommendations would be either Shop Helsinki-Mikebon (Simonkatu 9) or Kankurin Tapa (Phojoiseplanadi 35) which would be closer to your hotel. I am yet to book any of the above for your stay.

{"id": "e7fcac67-6ecd-4ceb-b4e0-d2ec8bfe71c5", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a concept that captures the obligation of a business to the environment, its stakeholders and the broader society (Blowfield, 2005). Over the years, the concept has evolved from corporate philanthropy (Bowen, 1953) to incorporate broader concerns such as environment and human rights, driven by social rights and legislative change (Carroll and Shabana, 2010). In recent years, CSR has been viewed as a link between business strategy and sustainable development, causing companies to utilise industry standards such as the United Nations Development Goals and Global Compact. This pressure from stakeholders to go beyond the minimal requirements allows companies to address broader goals and objectives, and by doing so, a positive brand image is created (Carroll, 2016).<nl>Political influence can be defined as a \"social influence process in which behaviour is strategically designed to maximise short-term or long-term self-interest, which is either consistent with, or at the expense of other’s interests\" (Ferris, Russ and Fandt, 1989). Political CSR is described as activities where \"CSR has an intended or unintended political impact, or where intended or unintended political impacts on CSR exist\". Therefore, political CSR can be used in three ways, which will be analysed further; these include being used as a substitute for non-conventional forms of political activity or directly supporting conventional political activities such as lobbying and constituency building. Additionally, CSR can be used in a novel or innovative way which does not directly correspond to political activity (Frynas and Stephens, 2014). This assignment will evaluate research surrounding the relationship between CSR and political activity, analysing the three ways CSR has been utilised to advance corporations political standing concerning real-life cases.<nl>The reasons in which CSR can be strategically used generally concerns initiatives to build corporate brand image or reputation, constituency building, building relationships and even agenda setting whereby donations can reinforce key industry messages to shift perceptions (Fooks and Gilmore, 2013). In order to analyse the relationship between CSR and political influence, this report will be focusing heavily on the research surrounding Coca-Cola, British American Tobacco and oil and gas companies. However, it must be noted that there is a limitation of the research surrounding the relationship between CSR and political influence, as it primarily focuses on these industries.<nl>Industries surrounding public health and the environment has been seen to invest heavily in CSR operations to \"offset\" their negative brand image and gain political support due to operations that are seen as working directly against society’s benefit (Fooks and Gilmore, 2013). For-profit corporations have been increasingly promoting that they act as partners with government and communities to address social problems. These partnerships are what Coca-Cola’s former CEO refers to as \"connected capitalism\", in which collaborations help maximise shareholder value (Foster, 2014). In turn, by utilising constituency building, corporations can facilitate access to policy elites and build relationships with them. This relates to a global triangle, an approach to sustainability in which business, government, and civil society join. Coca-Cola’s CEO claims the partnership system Coca-Cola has developed is \"the most beautiful example\" of the golden triangle where each party can come together and make a difference to big societal problems (Radtke, 2013).  Although CSR sees an increasingly political role for business firms, corporations are analysed to \"step in\" using \"a global triangle\" to fill governance gaps which they present as governments failing to do so alone. This positioning to take on political responsibilities is seen as a way to present themselves as pursuing public interests whilst pursuing their own political interests whilst building relationships (Eberlein, 2019).<nl>CSR as a means of Constituency Building and Facilitating Access to Policy Elites<nl>Ha and Hoang (2020) discovered a positive relationship between corporate social responsibility and political risk, suggesting that firms are more likely to invest in CSR as an \"insurance mechanism\" against adverse political events. Corporations can utilise CSR to support conventional political activities through constituency-building strategies to establish relationships with key opinion leaders, policymakers, media, and community involvement. In turn, this attempts to influence public policy by gaining the support of voters and citizens, who in turn express their preferences to political decision-makers (Mialon et al., 2016) (Hillman and Hitt, 1999). Although constituency building is a relatively robust strategy, Rehbein and Schuler (2013) argue that it is hard for companies to implement effectively. This is due to the difficulties convincing societal groups to politically participate, showing the support of a corporation. Even if stakeholders were to participate, it is hard to guarantee their effectiveness (Mialon et al., 2016).<nl>Neu et al. (1998) discussed that firms expanding their efforts to manage their legitimacy forestalls regulatory activities by the state that might occur without these efforts. Therefore, utilising CSR as a method of constituency building can minimise the political, legislative changes that can broadly impact businesses due to the legitimisation effect. For example, Mialon et al. discovered that Coca-Cola in Australia heavily used constituency building strategies by using CSR to have relationships with health organisations, community groups and policymakers. More specifically, Coca-Cola developed an initiative to encourage physical activity for kids called \"The Happiness Cycle\", partnering with an Australian charity. This was also interpreted as an agenda-settingframing activity as the company promoted the initiative to \"curb obesity\" and emphasised that they wished to be \"part of the solution\" (Mialon et al., 2016).<nl>By using their reputation and influence in a region gained by their CSR initiatives, companies such as Coca-Cola can wield power in governmental organisations. This was present in India, where two members of FSSAI (Food Safety Standards Authority India) are affiliated with an organisation funded by Coca-Cola. This organisation has undermined public health policies by networking with nutrition sciences to nudge \"government policy into alignment with the company’s corporate interests\" (Greenhalgh, 2019). By employing CSR through community campaigns, corporations can gain a sense of \"legitimacy\" that forms a sense of trust, increasing the likelihood that constituency building will be effective and increase their political influence. Furthermore, enhancing legitimacy enables corporations to conduct business activities more effectively than firms that do not engage in community CSR activities and may help minimise risks such as shareholder activism, boycotts of products and negative media coverage (Mirvis, Googins and Rochlin, 2007).<nl>However, Mialon et al.’s research surrounding the food industry's corporate political activity can be criticised because it could only incorporate publicly available information. This means that the research is unlikely to give a complete picture of the practices adopted by the food industry, as there is a lack of public documentation surrounding political activity, such as lobbying policymakers and private interactions. Therefore, this questions the validity of their findings, and the specific details of how CSR industry practices influence political activity needs to have further investigation.<nl>Exploiting CSR politically to work with other influential groups creates the perception that the message a corporation wishes to convey is balanced and credible, adding to the benefits of using CSR as a means of constituency building (Friedman et al., 1994). Using statistical analysis, Navarro (1998) concluded that although a company’s philanthropic activities can enhance brand image, increasing the effectiveness of lobbying activities, there was no direct relationship found between CSR activities and policy outcomes. As suggested previously, only firms working against public welfare will be using CSR to gain political influence, such as those within public health and energy industries. Therefore, as Navarro’s study incorporated a range of firms from different industries, it was unlikely to find a correlation between CSR and political outcomes. <nl>CSR can be strategically utilised to meet stakeholder needs and improve a company’s competitiveness and profitability (Porter and Kramer, 2006). CSR can be used to gain a positive brand image to attract more customers with the increasing demand from stakeholders for companies to adopt socially responsible practices to create a more sustainable and equitable world. Not all CSR initiatives are used to gain political influence, but the benefits of a positive brand image indirectly can help firms gain political power through Constituency and Relationship Building.<nl>CSR as a means of Agenda Setting<nl>As mentioned previously, CSR is also used as an Agenda Setting method to produce political effects. Fooks discovered a close connection between agenda-setting and constituency building where donations were allocated by BAT to groups \"based on their potential to shape policy agenda through their influence on government thinking and news reporting\" (Fooks and Gilmore, 2013). Smoking tobacco is the leading cause of death, illness and impoverishment, killing more than 8 million people each year (WHO, 2020). However, despite this significant public health crisis, tobacco companies and other unhealthy commodities utilise CSR as a PR initiative to create the illusion that they are a \"changed\" company and operate with health interests (WHO, 2009). Research by Fooks et al. analyses that Philip Morris and British-American Tobacco (BAT) engages in CSR primarily due to the potential to promote policy outcomes that work against public welfare. Specifically to prevent the introduction of effective government regulation, which has a record of effectiveness in reducing tobacco consumption (Fooks et al., 2012). Utilising CSR as an Agenda Setting method has allowed BAT to make donations towards reinforcing industry messages designed to alter the discussion of tobacco control away from public health and more towards the economic impacts and employment opportunities the industry gives.<nl>Agenda setting aims to manipulate public awareness surrounding issues prevalent in an industry that directly correlates to Coca-Cola. Hamilton (2015) discovered that Coca-Cola’s press releases surrounding CSR have a language that exhibits a paternalistic mentality with words like \"serve,\" \"help,\" and \"provide\". This paternalistic activism contends that outsiders are not best equipped to solve social and environmental issues, therefore boosting the image of their importance. The corporation exhibits a \"power-over\" approach that analysed as robbing communities of the \"decision-making process that affect their lives\" (Ledwith and Springett, 2010). It is hard for the general population to gain back their political influence from corporations acting in a CSR positive way when considering the substantial disparity between communities and Coca-Cola’s access to resources, political decision-makers, and media outlets (Hamilton, 2015). <nl>Additionally, in Georgia, USA, the Coca-Cola foundation pledged $3.8m to tackle obesity with the public health agency, the CDC (Radtke, 2013). The Times reported that the money given to the CDC contributed towards a strategy of funding scientists \"who encouraged the public to focus on exercise and worry less about how calories contribute to obesity\" (Kaplan, 2017). Utilising this charitable CSR initiative can take the narrative away from their unhealthy sugar-filled drinks contributing to obesity. By presenting themselves alongside their CSR projects using paternalistic vocabulary to the media, Coca Cola can shape the public agenda and shift perceptions of the underlying adverse effects of their operations and impact on public health. <nl>Gómez (2019) found that three primary factors can limit Coca-Cola’s agenda-setting influence, which is likely to impact other corporations. First, the ability of industry lobbyists to meet with legislative members; second, the pre-existing ties a government has with a corporation and the interests they have in benefiting from the companies’ operations and finally; the corporation supported researchers and activist’s vs the public health advocates, which are divided on opinions. All three of these limiting factors can have risk reduced by CSR initiatives surrounding constituency building, building relationships, agenda-setting and improving brand image.<nl>CSR as a means to support lobbying activities<nl>Regarding lobbying to change the narrative, it is a practice whereby a company or organisation aims to influence government leaders to create legislation that will benefit their industry somehow. The oil and gas industry has been reported as the 6th highest lobbying spender in the United States in 2020 (Duffin, 2021). It is common practice for oil and gas companies to engage in \"greenwashing\" to appear more environmentally responsible (Cherry and Sneirson, 2011). Nasiritousi (2017) wrote about oil and gas companies and how their input and attendance at climate change conventions is controversial as one of the most significant contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. However, they portray themselves as lobbyists against climate change and fund organisations which discredit climate science. These corporations spend countless amounts of money to change the narrative, such as campaigns that convince consumers that their lifestyles must change, as also seen with Coca Cola previously. Campaigns promote that humans are the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases- prevaricating the possibility that they are the largest polluters. Showing that they are \"reactive\" to these issues and rebranding themselves as part of the solution to the climate crisis helps to minimise the chances of a significant policy change being implemented that will further impact their business (Cherry and Sneirson, 2011).<nl>The oil and gas industry can be analysed using Goffman’s (1959) self-presentation theory whereby activities are analysed by a \"front-stage\" of how companies present themselves sustainably and the \"back-stage\" which relates to their corporate political activities. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) bill has been a considerable controversy for the oil industry. It was designed to allow oil investigations to occur in sensitive environmental areas (Cho et al., 2016). Environmentalists and Indigenous communities disputed the ANWR bill due to the irreparable impact oil companies would have on their land. Cho et al. (2016) analysed how oil firms sustainability and CSR practices pressed on the importance of environmental care, ensuring that their CSR practices were visible. However, they kept their proactive political actions targeted towards their interests of passing the bill \"back-stage\". This is a form of impression management whereby firms push CSR practices to an audience to be perceived favourably, and these elements are what the firms are getting more attention for. This method of emphasising positives and underplaying the negatives of their intentions is a common component of sustainability reports whereby corporations will seek to demonstrate how their activities are aligned with social expectations (Goffman 1959; Collinson 1999; Cho et al., 2016).<nl>Corporate Reputation and Image<nl>In addition, Chen et al. (2007) discuss how US companies with worse product and safety infringements were more likely to give to charity than those with better records. They analyse how CSR can be used as a \"distracting technique\" which is an innovative method of gaining political influence without directly operating politically. Their findings suggest that corporate philanthropy is used more for legitimisation than a measure of CSR performance. Companies can legitimise operations by utilising creative philanthropic activities by rebranding their image to reshape public imagination or ideology (Chen et al., 2007). <nl>For example, trans-national corporations (TNC) are known for exploiting the environment in emerging market economies more commonly than developed economies. This is because TNC’s are likely to utilise the cheap labour and abundance of resources available in emerging market economies and exploit these for profit-maximisation purposes (Khanna, Palepu and Sinha, 2005). In order to minimise political changes such as increased taxes, emission permits and caps on natural resource use, companies can employ CSR initiatives to regions to improve the country’s infrastructure and social programmes, presenting themselves as a positive contributor to the region (Hohnen and Potts, 2007)<nl>In 2000, Coca-Cola established a plant in Kerala, India, where their bottling plant drew around 510,000 litres of water from open wells and boreholes. Non-governmental organisations (NGO’s) discovered that water table levels have decreased from 12m to 35m below the groundwater level. Local women and children had to walk nearly 5km twice a day to fetch water, although it was often unsuitable for drinking and bathing as the water burned their eyes and led to numerous skin conditions (Raj and Shaji, 2017). Additionally, harvest dropped by 40% due to the lack of irrigation, and Coca-Cola allowed toxic wastewater to flow into farmers’ fields near the bottling plants (Foy and Senker, 2012). Coca Cola has been documented to have numerous unethical violations worldwide, such as human rights violations in Columbia and environmental violations in India. <nl>However, The Coca-Cola Foundation has donated over $1 billion in contributions to enhance local communities’ sustainability, focusing on areas such as water conservation and recycling, economic empowerment for women, providing education, youth development, and other community and civic initiatives (Coca-Cola, n.d.). These donations are vital to governments that do not have the financial means to provide these services themselves, therefore relying on TNC’s heavily, which increases the power corporations hold in these regions (Willem te Velde, 2002). By positioning themselves as intensely involved in water conservation and community products, unethical behaviour is more likely to be overlooked, and instead, stakeholders will focus on the positive efforts made (Johnston, Amaeshi, Adegbite and Osuji, 2019). So, by engaging in CSR practices, incorporating business initiatives that benefit society, Coca Cola can uphold its positive image as a family-focused brand whilst minimising chances of political penalties on operations.<nl>Although the theory of using CSR as a method of distraction which Chen et al. (2007) discusses, was a strongly developed argument that companies with worse environmental and product safety history were more likely to give to charity than those with better operational history had some limitations to consider. The research focused on the pattern of charitable donations as purely a distraction technique, ignoring the discussion on the other reasons and effects of the patterns of charitable giving such as political CSR. Despite this, the research mentioned above shows a pattern of CSR encouraging bad behaviour to more likely be overlooked and instead, stakeholders will focus on the positive efforts made (Johnston, Amaeshi, Adegbite and Osuji, 2019). So even though CSR can be used as a distracting technique per se, the charitable contributions produce a legitimisation effect, which can help with political activities such as lobbying, access to policy elites, and constituency building due to the increased positive brand image.<nl>Final Analysis to Conclude<nl>It is without a doubt that there is a strong relationship between corporate social responsibility and political influence from the research provided above. However, as expressed previously, different industries are likely to use political CSR in vastly alternative ways, leading this topic to be challenging to analyse. Most research surrounds public health and environmental corporations that produce negative externalities to society. Therefore, even though the research utilised shows the strengths in the relationship, it cannot be entirely reliable and applied to all industries.<nl>The research provided in this paper suggests that there is a relationship whereby CSR is used as an insurance mechanism against political risks, insinuating that corporations are likely to increase CSR activities when the political environment is uncertain. Without a doubt, industries working against the public’s welfare have benefitted from using CSR as a means to gain political influence, as seen with the oil and gas industries \"greenwashing\" activities, Coca-Cola’s constituency building and BAT’s donations to shape policy agenda. Additionally, improving brand image has been seen to help corporations legitimise operations to shape the views of the public and policy setters by forming a sense of trust.<nl>In order to identify the true relationship between corporate social responsibility and political influence, it would be necessary to expand research in a broader range of industries. The available research displays a pattern between increasing CSR practises when operational activities are not in the public interests. Therefore, it can be concluded that there is a strong relationship between CSR and political activities, at least in the industries concerning public health and energy, or involving questionable product safety. If this were applied to industries that do not primarily work against public welfare, there would be a weaker relationship between CSR and political influence.", "<addr9_FN>,<nl><nl>Thank you so much!

They offer a variety of transportation including; car-sharing and exotic car hiring. Enterprise Holdings is its parent company with over 100,000 branches worldwide, employing more than 100,000 people (Enterprise.co.uk, 2020). <nl><nl>Enterprise Holdings acquired City Car Club expanding to ‘Enterprise Car Club’ who hold a variety of fuel-efficient cars and vans rentable by the hour or day, through mobile devices for bookings, unlocking and returning using iOS and Android applications with tailored plans (Enterprise Holdings, 2020). <nl><nl>Membership entails fuel servicing, breakdown cover, insurance, cleaning, and MOTs. A vehicle is only paid for when required not otherwise. <nl><nl>This report will demonstrate a yearly period plan including different actions split over months to boost brand awareness amongst the student demographic at Aston University. <nl><nl>Segmentation, target market, differentiation and positioning <nl><nl>Segmentation is the process of dividing markets of potential customers into specific groups based on common characteristics, reducing the risk of an unsuccessful marketing campaign. The segmentation will investigate students on and off campus interested in vehicle usage whilst at university (TrackMaven | The Marketing Insights Company, 2020).<nl><nl>A target market is the group of individuals a business aims to sell its products and services to, where marketing messages can be crafted effectively once the market is established (Omicsonline.org, 2020). The target market is aimed towards the student demographic at Aston University on and off campus coming from different towns and backgrounds. It is innovative to allow students to drive flexibly instead of incurring the cost of a vehicle overall for commuting. The segment could become profitable through promotional activities and distribution channels after identifying the segment’s needs. (Marketing-Insider, 2020).<nl><nl>Differentiation of Enterprise Car club is offering a self-service car rental plan, tailored to students at cost-effective prices with virtual membership and option to rent by the hour or day, alongside a monthly membership option currently priced at £5.95 per hour and monthly prices at £6 per month subscription. This is more accessible to a younger demographic of students who typically use mobile technology frequently. Aston University students could see this as an opportunity to benefit by not spending significant amounts, especially with current rising costs of living. <nl><nl>Positioning refers to a business’s ability to influence perceptions of consumers concerning a brand or product. The main objective is to establish an identity of an offering, so customers perceive it positively (TrackMaven | The Marketing Insights Company, 2020). <nl><nl>Enterprise is a company that is going to be offering a cheap and available service to students alongside reducing carbon footprints(reference). This could attract segments of the demographic, who favour being conscious of the environment for the future. (reference)<nl><nl>Enterprise Rent A Cars’ already significant profile to allow consumers to feel safe with the company’s new service, proving the reliable position they already pose compared to competitors such as CO-wheels CarClub and SIXT. Students can be targeted through social media platforms and through campaigning on university campus similarly to UberEATS, by employing campaigners to increase awareness.<nl><figure><nl>A perceptual map is a tool used to differentiate competitors and highlight any gaps in the market. It shows our business as a high quality and low-price service, highlighting the potential for the brand to succeed and gain awareness amongst students. One of our main competitors is SIXT, discovered by constructing this perceptual map, we have established our advantage as we offer suitable age restrictions on the use of rentals as students will want to travel inside and outside of Birmingham more frequently. <nl><nl><figure><nl>Campaign objectives <nl>Specific is a clear, precise and directional objective put forward to understand what results are expected within the workforce, instead of the objective being generalised, causing confusion and poorer results (Lalama, 2015). An effective goal would be to increase sales by a certain percentage or increase the target on a weekly, monthly or yearly basis. <nl><nl>Our specific objectives are <nl>1)To attain 500 (or more) student buyers of the service before year-end at Aston University to reach our precise objective. <nl>2)To improve awareness of the Enterprise Car Club for the car rental service <nl><nl>Measurable measures a goal and is the stage where numbers come into fruition to keep track of progress. However, it can be difficult to understand if an objective has been reached. <nl><nl>Our measuring will be through:<nl><nl>1)Using surveys to measure student’s demand based on needs and wants, <nl>2)Identifying any potential niches. <nl><nl>This would allow the measurable objective of attaining 40-50 subscription members each month and link to the founding values of the company to honour consumers by listening to them.<nl><nl>Achievable goals are setting goals in a realistic period by taking small, planned steps towards a goal. <nl><nl>1)An example of a goal to be set is attaining data within each quarter of the year alongside aiming to increase brand awareness by 10%. Additionally, once achieved, the goal can progress to 20 new subscription members to achieve progression. <nl><nl>Overall this will contribute to the objective of reaching out to Aston University staff and students, with reasonable pricing that is visibly differentiated to competitors.<nl><nl>Realistic is forming goals based on the context of current economic, organisational and market conditions (Anon, 2020). <nl><nl>1)The current economic state will determine the likelihood of success when aiming to increase sales, as this would not be the best goal to set if the country is close to experiencing a recession period in their economic cycle.<nl><nl>2)Being the best low-cost provider is an example of a realistic goal for Enterprise CarClub profile competition, considering economic uncertainty in the UK because of Brexit. People may be less inclined to invest in vehicle ownership or maintenance because of the potential future inflation rate and currency value volatility.<nl><nl>3)Targeting 500 students as dealing with a small target market in the geographic location of Birmingham, this is a link to what we want to achieve and realistic. <nl><nl>Targeted &amp; Timed is using a specified deadline to reach a goal. If a time expiration does not exist, it will hinder efforts towards an achievement and evaluation.<nl><nl>1)Trying to achieve the specified number by the end of the year at Aston University, the target will be achieved through pushing collaborations through social media, helping target and appeal to the target market. <nl><nl>2)Customers will be more engaged with the services being offered, whilst measuring the effectiveness of this approach during and after and if results are proving unsatisfactory, measures can be taken to improve consumer satisfaction (Fill and Turnbull, 2016). <nl>Strategy and general rationale for specific tools <nl><nl>In the marketing strategy, there has been research on five stages, concerning our strategy. In initial thought, developing a strategic mission, vision and values allow Enterprise CarClub to set its standard to consumers and provide a positive image for their services. Setting objectives as stated in campaign objectives would be important to reach the vision, but meeting targets will only be possible if a strategy is tailored to the intended path. Executing the strategy would be the next step aided by prerequisites put in place, for example; a Gantt chart to work with, values to work towards goals and a mission to work on present communications to gain significant awareness. After executing the strategy, the focus is on analysing the external environment continuously, alongside the company’s internal situation to identify corrective adjustments (Gamble, Thompson and Peteraf, 2019).<nl>General rationale for specific tools selected:<nl><nl>In the marketing plan, looking further into advertising as a negotiated form of traditional and digital communication from an identifiable source can influence audiences. In the marketing plan, we are looking to follow a push strategy through Enterprise’s profile to attract the target market to buy subscriptions. It will allow Enterprise CarClub to reach the goal of building awareness with students, encourage and incentivise them to build a differentiated strategy in competition with others. A community of consumers can be built alongside the strategy by considering and monitoring brand image. (Richards and Curran, 2002).<nl><nl>Secondly, Sales Promotion is going to be used as it influences consumers in a way to buy a product (Fill and Turnbull, 2016). It is a tool that will influence student behaviour positively as incentives will be offered to trial the service initially and then decide to proceed if satisfied. A pull strategy will reel in consumers through discounts, bonuses, and coupons creating a feeling of need for the service. <nl><nl>Marketing Tool Plans- <nl>Advertising Tool<nl>Advertising is a strong form of communication that will enable Enterprise CarClub to reach their audience through engaging using a variety of resources, using the media category to carry advertising messages to allow for the use of billboards, magazines, digital newspapers and mobile and online advertising (Fill and Turnbull, 2016). <nl><figure><nl>Digital media has a strong level of interactivity in modern lives with social media being very prominent, for example, Instagram. Using this tool will provide Enterprise with a giant opportunity for advertisement (Fill and Turnbull, 2016). It is prefered to use this tool because of the benefits it will bring in terms of reaching a wider audience, especially with electronic word of mouth having a large impact and high level of users. Advertising holds the credibility to support marketing efforts such as; sales promotion, using methods to secure customers into the car rental subscriptions as consumers spend on what they believe will bring them reputable value. <nl><nl>Advertising holds the capability of effecting knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, behaviour of a target audience, persuading individuals to buy a product they have never purchased. It can suggest that advertising can increase sales using manipulative and psychological techniques with a large segment of passive consumers concerning the ‘Strong’ theory of advertising (Fill, 2009). <nl><nl>The (AIDA) model presents creating brand awareness of a product or service, the interest of the benefits of its uses to build sufficient foundation to encourage the buyer to research further, desire to go forward with an emotional connection through brand personality making consumers want it and action to make the buyer take the next step of engaging in making a phone call, signing up to a newsletter or engaging in a live chat for further information.<nl><nl>With awareness, a PR campaign can be running towards the student target market each month with different resources. Interest wise we could use surveys to gain student interest on campus to then offer further consultation after gaining the initial interest of what is important to their tailored service. Desire could lead to running local buzz campaigns to generate discounts due to the curiosity of a new service. An action could be to use local advertising alongside social media to receive discounts during face to face or phone advertising to show empathy to needs for the short term or long term (How much do celebrities and influencers get paid for social posts? - Our Social Times - Social Media for Business, 2020).<nl><nl>Sales Promotion Tool<nl><nl>Sales promotion offers an incentive to encourage target audiences with promotional messages to buy the product sooner than later (Fill and Turnbull, 2016). It creates a differentiated strategy, launching the new Enterprise CarClub at Aston University by offering value to customers through planning sales promotion to incentivise students. Upselling opportunities are created with a variety of packages, starting from £4.50, enhanced at £3.45hour and under 22s at £5.95hour plans.<nl><nl>Sales Promotion presents the entrance to a partnership endorsement by sponsoring our car rental service. A well-known Birmingham hip hop artist ‘Mist’ will be integrated, who possesses a following of 670,000 (Instagram.com, 2020). By working in collaboration, this will build brand credibility and make the brand stand out to the demographic at Aston. Consumers will recall and remember the promotion, bringing in targeted behavioural marketing. Therefore, the student’s interest is captured, making them feel more inclined to sign up for the subscription (The Pros and Cons of Celebrity Endorsements - Baer Performance Marketing, 2020).. This partnership will offer a promotional online code discount and print coupons associated with himself to pull in more consumers to use the service, working towards the goal of reaching 500 buyers by year-end. He is already proactive in supporting Birmingham to make the city a better place through his involvement in projects, he will be more inclined to partner at a lower price than expected by an influencer of his popularity. (Mist Interview: U.K. Star Talks Hometown of Birmingham &amp; U.S. Rap Influences| Billboard, 2020). <nl><nl>Endorser attributes tie in with the TEARS model of trustworthiness, relating to endorsement being someone who can be trusted, have respect and expertise in the brand, physical attractiveness with pride in his health. Coming from a disadvantaged background in Birmingham, then progressing resonates with the target audience as students use him as inspiration towards goals. To have someone who is not just someone with a conative but affective strategy too, makes consumers feel to act on the Enterprise CarClub through a use of display of emotion and care (The Five Components in the TEARS Model of Endorser Attributes T Trustworthiness | Course Hero, 2020).<nl><nl>Managerial accountability allows the results of sales promotion to be easily justified in comparison to advertising. This way the margin for error as a calculated number will help in realising if the chosen promotion is effective towards our target market (Fill and Turnbull, 2016; Difference between advertising and sales promotion, 2020). <nl><nl>Implementation plan demonstrating the relative scheduling of Marcom tool activity:<nl><figure><nl>Creating the Gantt chart has enabled the 12 months of promotion for Enterprise Car Club to be planned out month by month. It establishes clear objectives and timeframes for which each tool should be executed. Using the advertising tool helps build brand value and image by encouraging change in consumer behaviour. <nl>For the advertising tool, TV advertisements, billboards, and promotional products will use the pulsing marketing strategy. <nl><nl>These are scheduled as a continuous schedule lasting the whole year at a low level throughout, becoming heavier during the peak times for selling (Continuous Advertising Definition | Marketing Dictionary | MBA Skool-Study.Learn. Share., 2020). <nl><nl>The peak times here are September, to take advantage of the advertising opportunities during freshers when students are most interested. Also, from December to February, the advertising tool is being used alongside our sponsor Mist performing, allocated sufficiently before the event and after to keep the awareness going. <nl><nl>Viral marketing is a flighting strategy due to the one-month period it is allocated solely to throughout the year. Within the advertising tool, internetsocial media adverts will be the continuous marketing strategy, as they will be available and shown to customers throughout the whole year, unlike the other tasks within the tool (Flighting, 2020). <nl><nl>The sales promotion tool will make use of discountscoupons and loyalty schemes as a continuous marketing strategy. These methods will always be available to consumers, so they are reminded of the need for the services, regardless of sales performance at any given time of the year. The fresher’s fair, contests, exhibitions, and fairs will all be making use of the flighting strategy as the advertising will be run at certain planned times, then have a cessation period throughout the year<nl>(9 Benefits of Sales Promotions - Gary A. Sanchez, 2020).<nl><nl>Integration of marcoms <nl><nl>Our specific objective is to improve awareness of the Enterprise Car Club for the car rental service and to attain 500 (or more) student buyers of the service before year-end at Aston University to reach our precise objective. Advertising and sales promotion have been decided as the two main tools because of brand awareness it will provide the up and coming brand. Advertising is informing and reminding about the products and services and a form of mass communication and links to sales promotion goals to increase sales quickly using discounts for example. Considering the timeframe and the main aim to build awareness in the Aston student’s target market, these tools provide a gateway to pull in consumers through trailing the service and use of endorsements to capture loyal customers.", "<addr16_FN>,<nl><nl> <nl><nl>The Modules I want to do are:<nl><nl><table><nl><nl><module1> does not appear on the module list.<nl><nl>Instead of \"<module2>\" I would like to consider <module_code> <module3>, however this is only listed as a module but has no ability to select or official released specification so I’m not sure if that one would be possible<nl><nl> <nl><nl>Thank you<nl><nl> <nl><nl><part_FN><new>Hi <addr17_FN>,<nl><nl>I wanted to revisit my module options despite already submitting them.<nl>I have had a couple issues with my options which I hope you are able to assist me with.<nl>I’m in my first year of <course> and I’m interested in choosing either  <module_code1> <module1> or <module_code2> <module2> to replace one of my options.

A diagnosis of ASD according to the DSM-IV-TR entails a minimum of two social impairments, one communication and one in restricted and repetitive behaviours (RRB) (American Psychiatric association, 1994). The ‘Big 3’ psychological theories are Theory of Mind (ToM); Weak Central Coherence (WCC) and executive dysfunction (ED).<nl>ToM is the ability to attribute mental states to oneself and others (Tager-Flusberg, 2006). 80% of children with ASD, failed the Sally Anne false belief task (which investigates ToM) (Baren-Cohen, Leslie &amp; Frith, 1985) compared to typically developing (TD) children. However, 20% of children still passed. This doesn’t account for performances by higher-functioning individuals with autism (HFAI), as Happe (1995) states passing false-belief tasks are predicted by verbal mental age. Furthermore, Happe’s 1994 strange stories test found individuals with autism (IWA) showed difficulties with irony, sarcasm, and metaphors. This can account for social and communicative impairments such as sustaininginitiating 2-way conversations, subsequently causing  failure to develop peer relationships. However, this may be due to under-connectivity in left-hemispheres (Verley et al, 2014). In addition, IWA also showed difficulty in reading eyes tasks (Baren-Cohen et al, 2001), which suggests impairments of joint attention (JA). Furthermore, children with autism, have impairments in following eyes andor giving appropriate eye contact (Neumann, 2006), as well as issues using declarative gestures. Baron-Cohen (1994) stated this was due to a deficit in shared attention, according to mind-reading system. This can explain social and communication impairments e.g., lack of shared enjoyment and failure to use non-verbal behaviours. However, ToM fails to account for RRB such as a tendency for routinesrules and circumscribed interests. <nl>ED involves deficits in planning, inhibition, and cognitive flexibility (Rajendran &amp; Mitchell, 2007). IWA show poor cognitive flexibility in the Wisconsin card sorting task (WCST) (Nelson, 1976). This can be due to perseverative behaviour. However, Minshew et al (1992) found perseverative ability is linked to verbal IQ as they found no differences between TD and HFAI. Thus, ED cannot solely and universally explain deficits. Furthermore, IWA have planning deficits illustrated in Tower of Hanoi task (Ozonoff &amp; Jensen, 1999). However, Hughes (1996) found IWA were able to do puzzles requiring  fewer steps. Although planning isn’t completely impaired, disruption of routinesrules causes distress to IWA (Rajendran &amp; Mitchell, 2007).<nl>Studies aforementioned do not account for individual differences, as performances may be different in HFAI due to  Verbal IQ. Furthermore, ED also occurs in individuals with schizophrenia and Tourette’s who perform similarly to IWA on executive function tests (Rajendran &amp; Mitchell, 2007).  This limits the potential of ED as a diagnostic marker for ASD. <nl>The Weak Central Coherence theory (WCC) (Frith, 1989) states IWA possess a bias towards local elements. Evidence for this is in embedded figures (Witkin, 1971) and block design tasks (Shah &amp; Frith, 1983), in which children with ASD displayed superior performance. Furthermore, Happe (1996) found IWA weren’t susceptible to visual illusions. These local biases can account for IWA showing pre-occupations for parts of objects. In further support, Hobson &amp; Lee (1998) found IWA do not process faces as a whole as they weren’t susceptible to inversion effect, due to this local bias processing. Furthermore, IWA show activity in primary visual cortex, linked to perception (Chung &amp; Son, 2020) which can explain performances, therefore, WCC isn’t a sole explanation for superior performances. Frith &amp; Snowling (1983) found IWA failed to use appropriate associations on homograph tasks, as they focused on sole words instead of the whole context, further supporting WCC. This can explain social communicative impairments such as sustaining conversation or developing relationships. Although, Lopez &amp; Leekam (2003) found IWA were able to use appropriate word associations in their visual homograph task suggesting such deficits are sensitive to task modalities.  <nl>In conclusion, the ‘Big 3’ psychological theories contribute to the ASD clinical profile to an extent.  ToM can account for social and communicative impairments, but not universally, as well as inability to explain RRB. Although, EDT can account for RRB i.e., adherence to routinesrules, is not exclusive to ASD. The WCC accounts for social and non-social behaviours but brain regions also play a role. This shows ASD is a multiple deficit disorder without a one theory fits all. The fractionation theory suggests the 3 domains are distinct at a cognitive level (Happe &amp; Ronald, 2008), but Russell et al (1991) states there is overlap between all domains highlighted in performances and theories, thus further research is need on domain specificity.<nl><nl><question2><nl>Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit atypical behaviours compared to typically developing individuals (TD). Lower-level processes such as  enhanced perceptual functioning (EPF); social motivational theory (SMT) and spontaneous mimicry (SM) may account for such differences.<nl>Evidence for EPF arises from embedded figures task (Witkin et al, 1971), as well as block design tasks (Shah &amp; Frith, 1983) in which children with ASD show superior performance to TD. In block design tasks, children with autism also show no further advantage to pre-segmented designs. This is due to perceptual processes being enhanced in ASD, which leads to locally orientateddetailed focused perception, compared to weak central coherence (WCC) which outlines a bias towards local elements (Charman et al, 2013). Thus, EPF highlights superiority in perceptual processing compared to processing style in WCC. Furthermore, IWA perform faster than TD children on conjunctive visual search tasks (Plaisted, O’Riordan &amp; Baron-Cohen, 1998) which further supports IWA have enhanced perceptual discrimination (Plaisted, O’Riordan &amp; Baron-Cohen, 1998) as EPF enables IWA to discriminate against colours and features resulting  in this faster processing. <nl>EPF can also explain savant skills, which are more common in ASD than the general population (Mottron et al, 2006), which highlights strengths of ASD. For example, exceptional drawing skills are due to EPF, as this encourages IWA to avoid perceptual closure, leading to more accurate and detailed focused drawings (Chamberlain et al, 2013). However, EPF doesn’t explain why this only occurs in some IWA, as there may be individual variations in processing perceptual information. <nl>EPF can also explain atypicality in sensory symptoms in IWA. Due to this enhanced perceptual processing, the threshold of detecting sensations is lowered (Lawson et al, 2015). However, Triomphe et al (2019) found IWA have atypical Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) modulation (linked to inhibition) which also explains tactile hypersensitivity in ASD. Therefore, EPF isn’t a sole explanation of why hypersensitivity occurs in IWA. Another limitation is EPF fails to explain why hyposensitivity occurs, and thus has weak explanatory power regarding sensory processing. <nl>Another low-level process in ASD is SM.  In electromyography responses in IWA, SM of emotional expressions is shown to be atypical (Beall et al, 2008) andor delayed (Oberman, Winkielman &amp; Ramachandran, 2009). SM is important for socio-emotional reciprocity, as Chartrand and Bargh (1999) found being mimicked makes people like us more. SM also underlies empathy (Drimalla et al, 2019). Therefore, this can explain impairments in developing relationships in ASD as well as a  lack of shared enjoyment displayed in ASD as IWA prefer to play on their own (Chevallier et al, 2012). <nl>The SMT explains deficits in social cognition related to lower-level processes.  Eye-tracking experiments by Klin et al (2002) found children with ASD look more at the background than characters in static social photographs. Furthermore, Vlamings et al (2010) found IWA have impairments in processing and identifying faces. According to EPF, this is due to enhanced processing of high spatial frequency information, an atypical process focusing on fine perceptual detail. However, the SMT states IWA  have less motivation to attend to faces as it is less rewarding, and this lack of experience can lead to poorer processing (Chevallier et al, 2012).<nl>Furthermore, Chamberlain, Rothman-Fuller and Kasari (2007) found children with ASD prefer isolated tasks compared to collaborative. Chevallier et al (2012) found this is due to selective social anhedonia (inability to feel social pleasure) in adolescents with ASD and this correlates with ASD severity. This explains impaired initiating and responding to in children with ASD in joint attention.   <nl>In conclusion, the above theories can contribute to atypical differences in ASD. EPF can explain atypical differences at a social and non-social level in ASD. SMT involves deficits in orienting to social information and behaviours which maintain social interaction (Chevallier et al, 2012), explaining social and communication impairments. Although, this cannot account for atypical restricted and repetitive behaviours (RRB) shown in IWA. In addition, despite SM being able to explain atypical social behaviours, it fails to explain communication and RRB. Failing to  account for a whole domain shown in IWA entirely shows serious limitations in using these theories for an explanatory power of the full ASD clinical profile. Furthermore, evidence given in support of these studies are task-dependent and artificial, such as eye-tracking and facial processing experiments as they do not reflect real-life settings. Likewise, lab studies lack validity and therefore may not be extrapolated. The above theories aren’t universal across all IWA as individual variations occur due to it being a spectrum disorder, as well as co-morbidity. Further research needs to be conducted on individual variations on atypical differences.<nl><nl><question3><nl>Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit atypical behaviours compared to typically developing individuals (TD).

The above theories aren’t universal across all IWA as individual variations occur due to it being a spectrum disorder, as well as co-morbidity. Further research needs to be conducted on individual variations on atypical differences.<nl><nl><question4><nl>Apraxia of speech (AoS) is an acquired motor speech disorder (Ballard, Granier &amp; Robin, 2000). Phonological representation is intact and there is no difficulty in motor realization, but there is an impairment in converting representations into a motor plan; this results in but isn’t limited to; phonological and phonetic speech errors, distorted prosody and groping (visibleauditory attempts to find right position for articulators) (Galluzzi et al, 2015). There are many accounts regarding the cognitive difficulties underlying apraxia which I will compare and contrast.<nl>Firstly, there is an impairment in knowledge, specifically, a loss of knowledge of word-sized articulatory programmes. The hypothesis states there is damage to a direct word route which impairs retrieval for articulatory planning. Instead, speakers have to use a less efficient, laborious route. Varley and Whiteside (2001) state some apraxic speakers (AS) have lost the ability to access stored plans and thus assemble speech from smaller units, which causes dysfluency shown in AoS. Furthermore, Varley, Whiteside &amp; Luff (1999) found there were no frequency effects in word durations with 4 AS. However, results weren’t significant. Contrastingly, Aichert and Ziegler (2004) propose brain damage in apraxia causes a loss of lower frequency routes and perseverations of higher frequency ones. This is consistent with a similar notion AS have an impairment in knowledge of the spatio-temporal parameters associated with speech, such as word retrieval in speech production,  which has also led to imprecise motor planning (Shriberg, Aram &amp; Kwiatkowski, 1997). Ziegler &amp; Cramon (1986) support this as they found AS have difficulties in knowing which parameters to use or knowing timings of lowering the velum, which can cause phonetic errors.  <nl>The reduced buffer capacity hypothesis (RBCH) is another account of cognitive difficulties underlying apraxia (Rogers and Storkel, 1999). Firstly, a limitation in the articulatory output buffer which is involved in phoneme-articulatory conversion. The speech motor buffer can only fit one syllable at a time; this can account for syllabic segregation, false stops, and  pauses between syllablesconsonants in AS. This means AS can’t activate several speech motor programmes simultaneously (Galluzzi et al, 2015). Secondly, there is reduced efficiency of the articulatory planner as the process of phonological to auditory conversion has become slower andor less precise (Buchwald &amp; Miozzo 2012), similar to the hypothesis above. This accounts for slower speech shown in AS with impreciseness explaining phonetic errors produced. In addition, RBCH states speakers may simplify consonants as they are more difficult to produce e.g., CCV template to CV template  (Bernhardt &amp; Stemberger, 1998). Deger &amp; Ziegler (2002) support this as they found AS had longer reaction times (RT) when producing alternating syllables and use simplification to reduce complexity. This explains pauses between syllable and phonemes, and consonant elongations. Both studies however have small sample sizes and aren’t generalisable across all AoS speakers. <nl>The program retrieval deficit hypothesis (PRDH) however states cognitive difficulties in AoS is due to interference in accessing articulatory plans. There is competition amongst motor programmesplans for selection due to similarity, and this generates errors and dysfluency in AoS (Mailend et al, 2019). This is supported by Mailend &amp; Maas (2013) who found AS showed significantly longer RT to say a pre-specified word when distractors were presented. Moreover, Galluzzi et al (2015) found frequency effects may be due to errors of selection due to an intrusion of phonetic  competitors; this interference activates corresponding phonetic words. In another study Mailend et al (2019) contrasted RBCH with PRDH. AS in their study were expected to show longer RT when prime and target words were different compared to identical (switch-costs). They found the switch-cost was more significant compared to other groups, as predicted by the PRDH, not the RBCH. However, this may be  due to participants knowing the target prior, which could jumpstart activation or from interference from competitors activated by the prime. Deger &amp; Ziegler (2002) found AS took longer to initiate two different syllables ‘da-ba’ compared to identical syllable sequence (da-da), which RBCH cannot explain as the ‘da’ is loaded to the buffer first and identical. <nl>In conclusion, there are numerous accounts explaining cognitive difficulties in AoS. All accounts above can propose for groping and have similaritiescontrasts of their perspectives of why impairments occur in AS.  However, experimental tasks aforementioned are limited as results may differ ranging from the severity of impairments, as brain damage and addition of Aphasia in some speakers could yield different results. Therefore, there isn’t one account which can explain all cognitive difficulties of AoS as results for experiments are inconsistent. Further research into the different hypothesis’ can help tailor treatments for AS.\"", "lo,<nl><nl> <nl><nl>I am a Second year <course> student at <university>.

Following the last email, that I had sent to you about my hospital visit whilst on placement in <city>, my health still hasn't improved so I am considering booking a flight home for  <month> to see my doctor as this is when we have a semester break. However, I have a block course in <month> for 4 days which is worth 3 credits and was just wondering if I would be penalised if I didn't partake in it? This would mean that I only have 28 credits for this semester and then would go on to take 31 credits next semester. So would end up with a total of 59 credits instead of 60. <nl><nl>Please can you let me know if this is acceptable or not?

I hope I can support you as best as I can in whatever way is helpful for you. <nl><nl>So I did a study placement at <university>. I chose to do a study placement as I wanted to improve my <language> language skills and they had a well renowned language programme at the University. The experience was literally one of the best things I've done in my life. I met so many people of different nationalities and made some amazing friends as well as really improving my language skills (written, spoken and in particular Grammar). If you want anymore information let me know. <nl><nl>It was really hard to adjust at first and I was really homesick. However, I just tried to integrate myself into all of the student events and talk to as many people as possible. As soon as I made friends then I felt a bit more settled and it took me a while to feel comfortable in using <language> day to day. However, you'd be suprised at how nice people are and they just appreciate trying to speak in <language> so just really go for it. I wish I had been a bit more confident to start with.<nl><nl>It's important to say as well that I was going to do a half study, half work placement at first but decided to stick with study as that was what was best for me. But I would highly recommend doing half and half as you get the best of both worlds and also it looks good employability wise. If you feel that you really struggle with grammar etc then I would definitely suggest half a study placement as it will aid you in final year when it comes to dissertation and assessments etc. <nl><nl>Yes please message me whenever and I will keep checking in on you as I really understand how difficult this year can be especially in the current climate. <nl><nl>Kind Regards, <nl><nl><part_NN>", " im so sorry I missed your call im in <country> with my family 😭 <pers_NN> friend thought he had <condition> but ended up not having it 🙄<new>Ywah after 3 is perfect with me!!
